# Wave ledger

One entry per engine/tooling wave: what triggered it, what was decided and WHY,
what changed, how it was gated. This is the hill-climbing memory — read it
before designing a wave so decisions compound instead of thrashing. Scores live
in `scores/history.jsonl`; behavioral contracts live in
`Packages/TypeEngine/Scenarios/*.scenarios` (scenario comments cite sessions);
architecture in `docs/adr/`. Newest first.

## 2026-08-19 — TestFlight 1.1 (23) publication

- **Built from** `15b0c28` ("engine: deep short acute-fold repair"), the head
  commit of the 2026-08-19 pair: `fa66815` (suggestions honor the typed
  token's casing — caps-lock fix) + `15b0c28` (deep short acute-fold repair).
- **Upload**: 1.1 (23), IPA SHA-256
  `c0358b0fa89406f41a3bc3c46b9b6121a31b337ca9dd71e291be58f3b8ae2424`,
  processed `VALID` with exempt encryption under build ID
  `6d305092-eeda-4038-9136-b5112be8586b`.
- **Groups**: assigned to internal `Innri prófun` (available immediately) and
  external `Vinir`; Beta App Review submission
  `6d305092-eeda-4038-9136-b5112be8586b` reached `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` on
  2026-08-19.

## 2026-07-30 — Wave 47: version-aware modern emoji repertoire

- **Trigger**: the bundled ISEmojiView plist stopped at 2,501 strings and was
  missing both modern base emoji and complete modifier/ZWJ families that iOS
  itself can render.
- **Decided**: generate one Unicode-authoritative catalog and select its tier
  from the documented Apple runtime boundary: Emoji 15.1 on iOS 18.0–18.3,
  Emoji 16.0 on iOS 18.4–26.3 and Emoji 17.0 on iOS 26.4+. The same predicate
  now controls browse, bilingual search, conservative suggestions, recents,
  frecency and variants; there is no glyph probing or network path.
- **Coverage**: the catalog contains 1,914 families and 3,944 exact sequences
  (3,773 at tier 15.1 and 3,781 at tier 16.0). Search contains 7,202 bilingual
  tokens and 18,350 postings; ordinary Icelandic suggestions contain 2,164
  exact matches.
- **Variant gate**: a screen-bounded horizontal long-press strip won over a
  tall grid and stateful two-stage picker. It exposes every exact mixed-tone
  sequence without clipping, using 44-point buttons and accessibility labels.
- **Cost/control**: generated runtime artifacts are 133,039 bytes for the
  catalog, 276,399 bytes for search and 50,730 bytes for suggestions. Search
  alone remains below the 1 MB retained-heap gate; complete catalog + picker +
  search measured 2,137,744 bytes on iOS 18.4 and is guarded by a 2.5 MB
  replacement ceiling.
- **Publication**: TestFlight 1.0 (17), built from `31066ec`, uploaded at
  2026-07-30 18:11:41 GMT and processed `VALID` with exempt encryption under
  build ID `e5d2211f-fa80-4329-89e7-b1bd65b0ffff`. IPA SHA-256 is
  `fab5de47afecfd6485d0d3a8322ffbdf56de5c2993c80553a3e6a975937e567f`.
  It was assigned to internal `Innri prófun` and external `Vinir`; Beta App
  Review reached `APPROVED`.
- **App Store 1.1 correction**: build 17 was incorrectly attached to App Store
  version 1.1 while its embedded marketing version remained 1.0, producing
  `Invalid Binary`. Commit `d9b7616` locks app and extension to 1.1 (18). The
  replacement build `517572a9-4e30-4aef-98ca-3dc68de96a98` processed `VALID`
  with IPA SHA-256
  `a18086afdb01375df3a343a8c3ce475ca039045a1a21d27d97da71173f7cdd31`.
  The stale rejected review was canceled and submission
  `579434ec-c5b2-4cf2-a274-6f375f0f99cd` reached `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` on
  2026-07-31 00:12:45 GMT.
- **App Store 1.1 + first subscription resubmission**: that app-only review was
  developer-rejected on 2026-07-31 so Lyklaborð+ could ship with 1.1. The
  subscription was repaired to 175/175 explicit Apple-equalized price records
  (USD 19.99 USA base; USD 22.99 Iceland), worldwide availability including
  future territories, complete version-scoped localization/image metadata, and
  the standard-EULA link in the App Store description. Apple has IAP v2 enabled
  for this app, so the legacy private-web `submitWithNextAppStoreVersion` path
  correctly failed with `ENTITY_ERROR.ATTRIBUTE.INVALID.UNMODIFIABLE`; first
  review instead uses version-scoped public review items. Replacement submission
  `67438604-e943-4a20-9c08-d889d20936b2` contains App Store version 1.1,
  subscription version `c6d16588-642c-4295-91f0-a82ef1aa6051`, and subscription
  group version `c97891d2-f6dc-48d0-b212-a9f21ed3ec76`. All three reached
  `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` at 2026-07-31 22:13:02 GMT.

## 2026-07-24 — Wave 46: bilingual emoji search

- **Trigger**: explicit emoji search only understood Icelandic, despite the
  keyboard's core promise being mixed Icelandic/English input.
- **Decided**: merge pinned CLDR 48.2 Icelandic and English names/keywords into
  one lazy picker-only search artifact. Keep Icelandic result and VoiceOver
  names, and leave ordinary suggestion-bar emoji Icelandic-only. Exact/prefix
  ranking is locale-neutral, with `hjarta` and `heart` both strongly mapping
  to ❤️.
- **Cost/control**: schema 4 grows the runtime JSON from about 86 KB to 217,888
  bytes for 1,586 emoji, 6,016 tokens and 14,595 postings. Compact token fields
  move Unicode boundary work to generation; Foundation substring matching
  avoids both the failed 67 ms/query Swift scan and a memory-heavy runtime
  inverted index. Gates remain one Debug frame/query and <1 MB retained heap.
- **Publication**: TestFlight 1.0 (16), built from `e48f0c6`, uploaded at
  2026-07-24 09:54:56 GMT and processed `VALID` with exempt encryption. It was
  assigned to internal `Innri prófun` and external `Vinir`; Beta App Review was
  submitted and reached `APPROVED` by 09:57:20 GMT.

## Standing doctrine (violating these needs an ADR, not a wave)

- **Conservatism invariant**: a word valid in either language is never
  auto-replaced (oblique-only dominance fallback is the one exception). The
  verbatim escape hatch is always in the bar.
- **Surface forms are ground truth**: Icelandic wordform overlap is extreme;
  learned vocabulary is byte-exact. Lemma-level lifting only when unambiguous.
- **Bidirectional tap evidence**: near-miss taps *enable* corrections,
  dead-center taps *veto* them — but restoration pairs (acute folds, d↔ð)
  never veto: the base letter is the only key that exists, so a dead-center
  tap is the lazy-input signal FOR restoration.
- **Lane relaxation**: diacritics are an input method, not errors. Acute
  vowels fold near-free inside a saturated IS lane; apostrophes/lone-i mirror
  in EN. Long-press is an absolute deliberateness veto.
- **Eval discipline**: never tune on a single report; dev corpus for tuning,
  heldout run once per wave and never tuned against; personal-eval.jsonl
  (real confirmed typing) must never regress. The zero-false-autocorrect hard
  gate is a curated micro-safety invariant; it is NOT a claim of zero wrong
  fires across the 3,000 generated-typo corpus. M1.5 adds baseline-relative
  corpus false-autoapply/top-1/top-3 gates by language and material category.
  False autocorrect remains the metric we guard most jealously — uncorrected
  dogfood under-reports it, so dogfood recordings are made WITH manual
  corrections. Gate command (local only, real typing data is gitignored):
  `type-eval personal` against `scores/personal-baseline.json`;
  `--update-baseline` accepts an accepted wave's result as the new floor
  (scores/README.md "Personal-eval gate"). Scenarios preserve known behavior;
  they do not certify aggregate system quality.
- **Extension privacy**: the keyboard extension has zero network/iCloud
  entitlements, forever. Sync and export live in the containing app.

## Active queue — 2026-07-18 M1.5 reset

`PLAN.md` owns execution order; this section is its compact operational view.
The lettered language-capability waves in `ICELANDIC_NLP.md` are evidence and
dependency planning, not a competing active queue.

1. **Wave 39 — cold-first-usable truth and budget (complete):** 20/20 verified
   process-cold Release runs on physical iPhone passed the strict gate; p95
   activation→engine-ready 55.8 ms, first-request→stable-result 27.4 ms,
   backlog drain 1.4 ms, maximum queued depth 1. The aggregate baseline is
   committed under `tools/cold-start/baselines/`. Bootstrap stays first,
   off-main, and single-stage; evidence does not justify staged publication,
   warm-up, or a fallback engine. Ranking is unchanged.
2. **Wave 40 — evaluation contract v3 (complete):** baseline-relative
   real-artifact quality/safety/stage gates, morphology-backed analyzer routing,
   language-artifact manifests/runtime budgets, and generated calibration
   sidecars are green. The clean replacement physical cohort passed 20/20;
   activation→engine-ready p95 is 11.9 ms and first-request→stable p95 is
   5.9 ms (both ~78% below Wave 39), with depth 1 and zero backlog drain.
3. **Wave 41 — timed last-mile replay gate (complete):** the real session
   queue, shared production request sequencer/apply guard, separately published
   bar, and final proxy text gate delimiter application, stale delivery,
   fast-input queueing, and backspace/revert. Four of four cases pass.
4. **Wave 42 — decoder consolidation phase 1 (complete):** 19 stable bounded
   candidate-provider identities now feed a first-wins admission pool; named
   rank contributions and contextual/personal evidence are visible in
   `CorrectionTrace`; eight provider families and every exact provider are
   dev-A/B ablatable. Default suggestions, actions, scenarios, dev/heldout
   scores, and latency remain unchanged.
5. **Wave 43 — decoder consolidation phase 2 (complete):** the post-ranking
   action/safety decision is isolated behind an immutable policy input and an
   action-only configuration view. Search, ranking, action, touch, lane, and
   morphology now have read-only ownership views over the unchanged flat
   shipping defaults. Suggestions, actions, traces, quality, and latency are
   unchanged.
6. **Wave 44 — compact trigram context (assessment closed):** pinned Icegrams
   is useful as an offline teacher, but the real three-slot candidate study
   changed only 25/1,050 reachable context-rich IS decisions. Gate A required
   100, so no runtime, C++ bridge or shipping artifact is authorized.
7. **Wave 45 — Icelandic emoji browse search (release candidate):** explicit
   offline CLDR search now owns a private `.emojiSearch` query above the
   ordinary Icelandic keys. Query actions are firewalled from host text,
   autocomplete, learning and recording; only selected emoji reach the proxy.
   The compact picker cohort is 85,943 bytes and lazy-loaded.

Wave 44 is closed without a runtime feature. Continue real recordings in
parallel; a materially denser frozen context slice or a newer conversational
corpus can justify reopening it, but `context3.bin` is not in the active queue.

**Device verification debt (does not change the queue):** Wave 37's
long-press-eject confirmation and Wave 36's real `„völd` literal-revert path
remain open until their exact interactions are tested. The
2026-07-18T00-56-44 recording exercised neither exact check. Wave 39's physical
cohort is closed below.

## 2026-07-23 — Wave 45: Icelandic emoji browse search

- **Trigger:** suggestion-bar labels solved only the strong single-match case.
  Testers still needed an explicit Icelandic way to find every emoji without
  switching keyboards or leaking the phrase into the host field.
- **Height gate:** chose the fixed one-band layout. KeyboardKit already
  reserves a 50pt hidden toolbar in `.emojiSearch`, so query + horizontal
  results occupy that strip and alphabetic key geometry stays unchanged. The
  clear overlay remainder rejects hit testing; there is no dynamic extension-
  height transition, clipping or rotation state to fail.
- **Data/ranking:** the pinned CLDR 48.2 / Emoji 17 builder emits
  `is-search.json`: 1,586 picker base emoji, 2,798 tokens, 6,024 postings,
  picker SHA-256, positional name/keyword source, 85,943 bytes. Runtime
  validates schema/cohort/counts and ranks exact name > exact keyword > name
  token > name prefix > keyword prefix > accent-fold fallback, then
  frecency/stable order. `hjarta → ❤️` is the reviewed conventional override.
- **Privacy/action boundary:** an `@MainActor` session lazy-loads only on search
  entry. A pure firewall consumes real KeyboardKit character/space/backspace/
  repeat/Done actions before the proxy ledger, autocorrect, recorder or
  learning. Emoji taps alone use the existing `.emoji` release path and keep
  search open. Missing/corrupt data fails closed while retaining query
  ownership; external host mutations clear search without editing host text.
- **UX/accessibility:** browse exposes `Leita að emoji`; active search has a
  private query pill, clear control, frecency empty state, explicit no-match
  copy, ordered CLDR-named buttons and long-press skin tones. KeyboardKit's
  erroneous Icelandic “Done” translation is corrected to “Lokið”.
- **Gates:** deterministic generator check; exact/prefix/fallback/bounded
  ranking tests; proxy-spy, missing-data and host-mutation tests; <1MB retained
  malloc delta and <1/60s mean query tests; generic Release app+appex build;
  iOS 18.4 ReplayRig browse/`hjarta`/host-leak/insert path with captured
  storyboard. TestFlight 1.0 (15), built from `f826b68`, processed VALID on
  2026-07-23, was assigned to internal `Innri prófun` and external `Vinir`;
  beta review is APPROVED. The simulator memory gate is green; physical-device
  category-scroll/search cache growth remains an explicit dogfood observation.

## 2026-07-23 — Wave 44: compact trigram context (assessment complete; runtime stopped)

- **Trigger:** Miðeind Icegrams exposes real third-order Icelandic context, but
  product feedback rejects unsolicited n+1 prediction. The useful hypothesis
  is therefore narrower: previous-two-word evidence can rank the word currently
  being typed, especially agreement/inflection rivals that share the same
  immediately previous word.
- **Research evidence:** Icegrams pinned at
  `5538250cfcce9faca83cb6a630aed9e838ff1865` contains about 14.18M retained
  trigrams and 4.90M bigrams in a 43,064,803-byte mmap database derived from a
  vetted 2017 Icelandic Gigaword Corpus slice. Its current reader inflates a
  5,526,811-byte vocabulary. Local Mac probes measured 30.5 ms initialization,
  18.9 µs average exact lookup, and successor queries from 81 µs to 5.06 ms as
  fan-out rose. Python/CFFI footprint deltas are not iPhone/Swift forecasts.
- **Sizing evidence:** at context frequency≥200 and top-5 successors, the
  source shape retains about 216,836 contexts / 999,081 entries. A simple
  fixed-width representation is roughly 10–11 MB and a purpose-built packed
  sidecar plausibly 5–8 MB, versus shipping the 43 MB source database.
- **Assessed architecture:** do not port Icegrams wholesale or surface new
  default next-word UX. A native C++ bridge would be a benchmark/parity spike
  only; the preferred shipping path, if this is ever reopened, is separate
  generation-bound `context3-is.bin` / `context3-en.bin` top-K artifacts and a
  pure Swift mmap reader. Trigram is a named, ablatable rank contribution;
  absence is neutral, lanes are blended, and it cannot create a new action
  policy or arm autocorrect by itself.
- **Decision gate A (build authorization):** ≥10% attested coverage on
  context-rich reachable IS rival rows; ≥100 changed orderings at ≥3:1
  correct:wrong; ≥+0.5pp context-rich dev top-1; aggregate dev top-1/top-3,
  false auto-apply and protected EN/code-switch/safety slices non-regressing.
  A miss closes the runtime wave and keeps Icegrams offline-only.
- **Decision gate B (ranking activation):** compact results reproduce on
  heldout without any safety/personal regression; artifacts ≤10 MB IS / ≤20 MB
  combined; reader dirty delta ≤1 MiB and fresh-process peak <50 MiB; added
  physical-device rank latency ≤0.10 ms p95 / ≤0.50 ms p99; cold, request and
  last-mile gates remain green; ablation and missing/corrupt artifacts are
  exactly inert.
- **C++ bridge stop rule:** direct reuse remains in consideration only if the
  spike shows ≤8 MiB dirty delta, ≤50 µs p95 exact lookup, no hot-path all-child
  sort and explicit acceptance of the ~43 MB bundle increase. Even a pass does
  not displace the compact format without measured end-to-end advantage.
- **Frozen candidate result:** `type-eval export-candidates dev` now emits the
  production three-slot call's eight-candidate diagnostic pool and explicitly
  refuses heldout. The pinned offline study found 1,050 context-rich reachable
  IS repairs, with the gold trigram attested in 266 (25.3%) and discriminating
  evidence in 218 (20.8%). The best count signal changed 25 orderings: 21 wins,
  3 losses and one wrong→different-wrong change (7:1), moving top-1 from
  957→975 (+1.71pp) and top-3 from 1,026→1,032 (+0.57pp) on that slice.
  Conditional trigram-vs-bigram lift was weaker: at its best measured weight,
  20 changes / 15 wins / 3 losses and 957→969 top-1.
- **Gate A verdict — STOP:** coverage, win:loss and slice-quality thresholds
  passed, but only 25 decisions moved versus the predeclared ≥100 requirement.
  Even extreme count weights saturated at 25; extreme conditional-lift weights
  degraded from 12:1 to 1:1. This is a real but too-sparse gain to justify a
  new bilingual artifact, reader, scoring seam and device-memory burden today.
  Heldout was not exported or consulted.
- **Safety/UX interpretation:** trigram remains ranking evidence only; it may
  never authorize auto-apply or arm spacebar. The generated safety corpus is
  action-policy-oriented (the protected typed word is deliberately absent from
  the raw corrector candidate pool), so it cannot validate rank deltas; keeping
  action authorization unchanged is the hard protection if this is revisited.
- **Port decision:** the native C++ bridge was intentionally not built after
  Gate A failed. It could reduce Python/CFFI overhead, but cannot remove the
  43 MB source database and buys no additional product accuracy. The compact
  5–8 MB pure-Swift sidecar remains the right architecture if fresh real-world
  recordings or a newer conversational corpus make the evidence materially
  denser. Reopen only with a new frozen slice; do not tune heldout to rescue it.
- **Artifacts retained:** ignored `PLAN.md` keeps the dormant phase order and
  gates; `tools/trigram-study.py` plus the dev/safety exporter preserve the
  reproducible offline analysis path. No keyboard/runtime code changed.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 43: action-policy boundary and configuration domains (complete)

- **Boundary:** `Corrector` finishes candidate admission, exact scoring,
  deterministic ranking and trace-ledger assembly before constructing an
  immutable `AutocorrectPolicyInput`. `AutocorrectPolicy` owns the existing
  ordinary-unknown, split, protected-restoration and valid-word branches and
  returns only the auto-apply decision; it cannot admit, reorder or rescore a
  candidate. Trace branch names, gate order and arithmetic are unchanged.
- **Configuration ownership:** the flat `EngineConfig` remains the only store,
  keeps every shipping default, and remains source-compatible. `config.domains`
  snapshots read-only search, ranking, action, touch, lane and morphology
  views. The action implementation consumes only the action view, so a future
  cross-layer dependency becomes a visible code change rather than another
  implicit flat-property read.
- **Architecture contract:** three focused tests pin domain snapshots and the
  post-ranking ordinary/split/valid branch classification. The engine README
  and lab now show action policy as a distinct layer and route debugging to
  its source instead of the monolithic corrector.
- **Behavior/latency parity:** 482/482 package tests pass. The accepted
  scorecard remains dev 2,338/3,000 top-1, 2,541 top-3 and 121 false
  auto-applies; safety remains 16 expected hard-negative fires; compounds
  remain 208/233/17; all 251 scenarios and 4/4 last-mile cases pass. The final
  Release run measured 9.68 ms worst keystroke, 4.20 ms request p95, 4.31 ms
  backlog drain, and process-cold artifact load 163.0 ms / 14.6 MiB. The
  70-row personal gate remains 32 top-1 / 27 auto-applied / 9 false, with all
  3 intentional slang rows surviving unforced. Generic iPhone Release app +
  keyboard-extension build succeeds.
- **Heldout (single report-only run):** byte-identical at 2,289/3,000 top-1,
  2,506 top-3 and 159 false auto-applies (EN 1,080/1,190/108; IS
  1,209/1,316/51), with stages success 1,772, discovery 336, ranking 216,
  action abstention 517, action error 159 and zero session/proxy failures. No
  post-heldout behavior change or tuning was made.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 42: candidate provenance, named signals and ablations (complete)

- **Trigger:** `Corrector` had accumulated bounded search passes, but several
  wrote directly into either the channel-cost dictionary or scored tuple list.
  A missing candidate still required code archaeology, and the old trace
  backed morphology/compound/precedence into a misleading synthetic
  “language” score. There was no uniform way to measure a source's causal
  quality/safety contribution.
- **Provider contract:** `CandidateProvider` gives 19 search sources stable
  diagnostic names, from shallow/deep beam through restoration, completions,
  context, morphology, compounds and space splits. `CandidateAdmissionPool`
  preserves the historical first-wins channel cost while unioning overlapping
  provenance only when a trace is requested; production allocates no
  provenance dictionary. The scored split path carries the same provenance
  contract despite its pair-language score.
- **Named rank ledger:** every `RankedCandidate` records exact additive channel,
  weighted blended-language, morphology, compound-head and hard-precedence
  terms while assembling the score in the original floating-point operation
  order. `CorrectionTrace` now shows those terms, true raw blended language,
  context-free baseline/context lift, personal prior, per-candidate `via=`
  sources, pool-wide provider counts, and active ablations. Context/personal
  values are explicitly diagnostic evidence already contained in the blended
  language term, not double-counted addends.
- **Ablation surface:** the allocation-free `CandidateProviderSet` defaults
  empty in shipping config. `type-eval ab --disable-family` covers eight
  disjoint families (`beam`, `lexical-repair`, `restoration`, `context`,
  `completion`, `morphology`, `compound`, `split`), and
  `--disable-provider` targets one stable source; either composes with JSON
  config overrides. The context-family smoke run completed and reported dev
  top-1 +0.03 pp, top-3/false-autoapply ±0.00 pp when disabled. This is a
  diagnostic result, not a tuning decision—the provider protects observed
  short-token context cases outside the generated corpus distribution.
- **Behavior/latency parity:** the accepted scorecard is byte-identical to the
  Wave 41 floor: dev 2,338/3,000 top-1, 2,541 top-3, 121 false auto-applies;
  safety 16 expected hard-negative fires; compounds 208/233 with 17 false
  auto-applies; all 251 scenarios and 4/4 last-mile cases pass. Release bench
  worst keystroke was 9.42 ms (<30 ms), last-mile request p95 1.44 ms / drain
  1.32 ms, process-cold artifact load 148.1 ms / 14.5 MiB. The local 70-row
  personal gate has no regressions and all 3 intentional slang rows remain
  unforced. Package tests are 479/479 and the generic iPhone Release app plus
  keyboard-extension build succeeds.
- **Heldout (single report-only run):** unchanged at 2,289/3,000 top-1,
  2,506 top-3 and 159 false auto-applies (EN 1,080/1,190/108; IS
  1,209/1,316/51), with stages success 1,772, discovery 336, ranking 216,
  action abstention 517, action error 159 and zero session/proxy failures. No
  post-heldout behavior change or tuning was made.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 41: timed last-mile replay gate (complete)

- **Trigger:** the existing `ProxySimulator` scenarios exercised session and
  proxy semantics synchronously, while the extension publishes results from
  unstructured autocomplete tasks. The lab could not force a fast-input queue,
  suppress a superseded delivery, or prove that an older published bar failed
  closed at delimiter time. Unit tests for the pure guard were necessary but
  did not prove the composed document result.
- **Shared production boundary:** `AutocompleteRequestSequencer` is now the
  lock-protected monotonic request primitive used by both
  `LyklabordAutocompleteService` and the headless runner. Every queued proxy
  window still reaches the stateful `TypingSession` in order; only a completed
  result superseded by different newer text is withheld from the published
  bar. `Typist` also stamps its synchronous bar with the pending token and runs
  delimiter apply through `AutocorrectApplyGuard`, closing the old lab-only
  stale-apply blind spot.
- **Timed harness:** `type-repl last-mile` loads the exact shipping artifacts,
  confines the real session to a user-initiated serial queue, maintains a
  separate delivery queue/bar, records request→delivery/action/backlog timing,
  and asserts the final `ProxySimulator.document`. Its deterministic queue hold
  models a bootstrap/busy engine without changing ordering or bypassing the
  production sequencer.
- **Final-text cases:** (1) fresh `teh␠` → `the␠`; (2) deferred `teh.␠` →
  `the.␠`; (3) a held queue followed by fast `x␠` keeps `tehx␠`, records one
  stale apply skip, suppresses at least one older delivery, and reaches queue
  depth 2; (4) autocorrect commit → backspace → reserved `teh` literal tap
  restores `teh␠`. A failed case is scorecard-visible
  `sessionProxyFailure`; the hard requirement is zero.
- **Budgets:** request→delivery p95 <60 ms and max <120 ms, forced backlog drain
  <100 ms, action p95 <5 ms, plus 100% final-text cases. The focused Release
  run measured 2.03/2.45 ms request p95/max, 1.23 ms drain, 0.014 ms action
  p95, maximum queue depth 2; the full scorecard verification measured 1.42 ms
  request p95 and 1.29 ms drain. These are host regression gates, not a
  substitute for Wave 39/40's physical activation cohort.
- **Gates:** last-mile 4/4; scorecard v1 PASS (250/250 scenarios, 9.09 ms worst
  line, artifact load 149.1 ms / 14.4 MiB); TypeEngine/EvalKit 472/472; generic
  Release iOS app + extension build green. Wave 40's replacement physical
  cohort also passed before this ledger close, preserving execution order.
- **Accepted-wave follow-through:** the one allowed report-only heldout run
  passed every hard gate and measured 2,289/3,000 top-1, 2,506/3,000 top-3,
  and 159 false auto-applies (EN 1,080/1,190/108; IS 1,209/1,316/51), with
  zero session/proxy failures. The refreshed 70-row personal gate found one
  analyzer artifact (`a` deleted before commit, then unrelated `ef`) and one
  real failure: quoted English `„vold` was forced to Icelandic `völd`, dropping
  the quote. Short unrelated rewrites are no longer exported as correction
  pairs; candidates that drop a typed quotation mark are now offer-only. The
  exact proxy/session dogfood scenario is durable and the accepted personal
  baseline is 32/70 top-1, 27 auto-applies, 9 false auto-applies, with no
  regressions. Final rerun: 473/473 tests, 251/251 scenarios (dogfood 47/47),
  scorecard PASS (artifact 158.6 ms / 14.4 MiB, last-mile 4/4, bench 17.19 ms),
  and generic Release iOS app + extension build green. The quote branch is
  absent from heldout by construction, so the report-only cohort was not
  consulted a second time.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 40: evaluation contract v3 (complete)

- **Trigger:** the old green scorecard only proved a tiny curated micro set,
  scenarios, and one latency line. Real-artifact top-1/top-3 and false fires
  could move by language/category without failing; identity and valid-word
  preservation were absent; dogfood's prefix-shaped `INFLECTION_MISS` could
  be mistaken for morphology evidence; artifact freshness and runtime cost
  were prose rather than executable contracts.
- **Corpus contract:** `CorpusPair.expectation` distinguishes repair from
  preserve. The deterministic `type-eval generate-safety` corpus has 600
  real-artifact assertions: 400 clean identities and 200 valid-word hard
  negatives, balanced IS/EN. `scores/corpus-baseline-v1.json` requires exact
  suite/category/language cohorts and row counts, top-1/top-3 no lower, and
  false auto-applies no higher. Dev baseline: 2,338/3,000 top-1,
  2,541/3,000 top-3, 121 false fires. Safety baseline: clean identity 0/400
  fires; hard negatives 16/200 (15 IS, 1 EN), mainly deliberate restoration
  policy. Those 16 are now visible reducible debt, never a silently expanding
  allowance. Heldout remains report-only.
- **Failure ownership:** every corpus result is exactly one of success,
  discovery miss, ranking loss, action-policy abstention/error, or
  session/proxy failure, with overall/category/language tallies in scorecard
  JSON. Dev currently attributes 326 discovery, 215 ranking, 522 abstention,
  and 121 action errors; stateless replay correctly emits zero session/proxy
  failures, which Wave 41's last-mile rig owns.
- **Morphology evidence:** `type-repl :word` now exposes exact lemma candidates
  from the shipping BÍN binary. The analyzer batches those probes for intended
  and prefix-similar offered forms. A shared lemma upgrades the taxonomy to
  `inflection · watch`; absent an intersection, the result is
  `inflection-shape-hint · triage-uncertain` and cannot route roadmap work.
- **Artifact contract:** IS and EN generation manifests now enforce schema,
  source age at build/commit, source fingerprint, required shipping cohort,
  exact bytes, and streaming SHA-256 over 14 files. A fresh process under
  `/usr/bin/time -l` gates production-shaped load below 500 ms and peak
  footprint below 50 MiB, with no retry; final host verification was
  151.1 ms / 14.4 MiB. The normal keystroke bench separately passed at
  9.61 ms worst line.
- **Cold-path correction:** stable per-lexicon mean/σ calibration and a bounded
  warm-up set are now generation-bound hashed sidecars instead of ~20k prefix
  completion probes repeated on every extension activation. Invalid profiles
  fall back for test doubles, while production cohort drift fails the manifest
  audit. Host artifact load fell from roughly 181 ms to 151 ms with identical
  dev/safety/compound results and all 250 scenarios. The Release device build
  is green and contains both sidecars.
- **Physical transfer:** after archiving a transport-contaminated partial
  journal (five cold/two warm presentations) and clearing it, the strict runner
  collected a fresh 20/20 process-cold cohort with no rejected lines or
  duplicate ids on the same iPhone15,2 / iOS 26.5.2 / app+extension 1.0 (4).
  Activation→engine-ready p50/p95/p99/max = 9.8/11.9/13.9/14.3 ms;
  first-request→stable = 3.7/5.9/8.2/8.7 ms; backlog drain = 0 throughout;
  activation→stable p95 = 42.8 ms; maximum queue depth = 1. Versus Wave 39,
  activation p95 fell 78.6% and request p95 78.4%. Durable aggregate:
  `tools/cold-start/baselines/wave-40-calibration-iphone14pro-ios26.5.2-build4.json`.
- **Gates:** TypeEngine/EvalKit 469/469; analyzer behavior suite green (real BÍN
  `punktur`/`punkti` shared-lemma integration proven); scorecard v1 green;
  curatedSafety 0 false auto-applies + valid-word pass; corpus baseline green;
  14/14 artifacts green; 250/250 scenarios; Release physical build green;
  strict replacement physical cohort green.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 39: cold-first-usable truth and budget

- **Trigger:** bootstrap was already off-main, but neither the activation →
  usable-bar latency nor the queue hidden behind bootstrap had physical-device
  evidence. Retrying a surviving extension process could make a warm number
  look cold.
- **Instrumentation:** monotonic milestones start at controller `viewDidLoad`,
  before KeyboardKit/App Group setup, and end only on a non-empty result that
  survives delivery-side supersession. An explicit generation set proves the
  entire pre-ready backlog drained. The journal contains timings/counts and
  build/device metadata only—never proxy text, key values, suggestions, or a
  user identifier—and writes asynchronously after result publication.
- **Cohort hygiene:** `tools/cold-start/run-cohort.sh` dismisses the host before
  repeatedly terminating/rechecking the extension, proves an absent process at
  every launch boundary, and admits exactly one unique physical
  `isProcessCold` record per iteration. It aborts on lock, malformed/warm data,
  or a missing sample and can resume a valid partial cohort.
- **Measured result:** Release app/extension 1.0 (4), iPhone15,2 (iPhone 14 Pro),
  iOS 26.5.2 (23F84), 20/20 runs, one consistent cohort. Activation →
  engine-ready p50/p95/p99/max = 54.2/55.8/55.9/55.9 ms; first request →
  stable result = 22.1/27.4/28.7/29.0 ms; backlog drain =
  1.3/1.4/1.4/1.4 ms; activation → stable result p95 = 57.2 ms; maximum
  queued-window depth = 1. The strict v1 budget passed with no rejected lines
  or duplicate run ids. Durable aggregate:
  `tools/cold-start/baselines/wave-39-iphone14pro-ios26.5.2-build4.json`.
- **Decision:** retain the single serial engine stage and current off-main
  bootstrap. Do not add speculative warm-up, early partial publication, or a
  compact fallback engine: the measured p95 has roughly 4.5× headroom against
  the activation budget and 10.9× against the request-to-result budget. Add
  cohorts for older supported devices when hardware exists; do not mix device,
  OS, version, or build cohorts.
- **Gates:** cold tracker ordering/stability/backlog executable green; reporter
  7/7; strict physical cohort gate green; Release Simulator and physical-device
  app builds green; installed product metadata verified as `Lyklabord.app` +
  `LyklabordKeyboard.appex`.

## 2026-07-18 — Wave 38: current BÍN cohort + reproducible provenance

- **Trigger:** the architecture harvest found that both `lemma-is` and the app
  were silently building from a preserved 2020 `SHsnid.csv`. A morphology
  layer with no recorded snapshot/hash could make roadmap work compensate for
  stale language data and could mix incompatible morphology, paradigms, and
  governors.
- **Decided:** refresh the entire compatible language cohort from one current
  permitted BÍN/DIM Sigrúnarsnið snapshot before designing morphology v3. The
  exact source and every output live in
  `data/is/LANGUAGE_DATA_MANIFEST.json` under generation
  `bin-sigrun-2026-07-10-9c10d70d`; source SHA-256
  `9c10d70d73c03168f05f152616b8cafa6e4275e7db8701338f5f3c48a45b7ab6`,
  7,425,931 records, maximum BÍN id 569,933. The old cohort was preserved for
  comparison rather than overwritten without provenance.
- **Artifacts:** full morphology v2 is 115,189,168 bytes with 3,698,020 forms,
  347,926 lemmas, 5,811,045 analyses, and 414,007 bigrams; compatible core
  tiers were rebuilt with it. `paradigms.bin` now carries 47,460 lemma groups /
  889,605 entries / 447,316 forms; `governors.json.gz` carries 13,514
  governors. Exact byte sizes and hashes are manifest-owned, not repeated as
  floating prose elsewhere.
- **Behavioral finding:** freshness changes validity and therefore policy even
  without a ranking-code change. The new BÍN attests `fjögurhundruð` and
  `níuhundruð`; their standard split forms remain bar offers but valid-form
  protection now correctly prevents forced replacement. Recent vocabulary
  probes including `spjallmenni`, `hlaðvarpsþáttur`, `rafskúta`, `rafmynt`,
  `streymisveita`, and `kórónuveira` moved from unknown to known.
- **Gates:** LemmaCore 20/20, Lexicon 38/38, TypeEngine 454/454; scenario suites
  core 158/158, dogfood 46/46, inflect 13/13, touch 11/11, compounds 22/22;
  scorecard 250/250 scenarios with curated micro false-ac 0 and valid-word
  safety green; simulator app build green. The built extension's full
  morphology/paradigm/governor hashes matched the manifest. Swift mmap probes
  kept full-morphology open near 1–2 ms with roughly +0.25–0.28 MB physical
  footprint; the background gzipped-governor parse remains the known artifact
  cost and motivates, but does not jump ahead of, M1.5.
- **Close condition:** the cohort is refreshed and reproducible. Automated
  source-age/cohort enforcement remains Wave 40 evaluation infrastructure;
  richer morphology formats remain deferred until TypeEngine has a measured
  question the current reader cannot answer.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 37: long-press a learned suggestion to eject it

- **Trigger** (owner's idea, pairs with tap-to-learn which already works):
  tapping the quoted verbatim/`.unknown` slot LEARNS a word (KeyboardKit
  autolearn on `.unknown` → `learnWord`). The symmetric inverse was missing —
  when a bar suggestion is a word from the user's OWN learned vocabulary,
  LONG-PRESSING it should offer to forget it (remove/tombstone), without
  digging into the app's Orðasafn dictionary editor. Tap teaches, long-press
  forgets. Pure bar-interaction feature: the corrector is untouched (personal
  gate byte-identical, below).
- **Source flag — `isPersonalLearned` on the TypeEngine `Suggestion`**,
  derived from a new engine predicate `TypeEngine.isPersonalLearnedWord`:
  `personal.isValidWord(w) && !personal.isTombstoned(w) &&
  !isKnownAnywhere(w) && compoundSplit(w) == nil` — valid personal
  vocabulary (snapshot or session overlay) that is NOT otherwise valid
  (is.lex/en.lex/BÍN/productive compound). This is exactly the ejectable
  class: a word the user ALONE taught the keyboard. Base words (og, það) are
  never flagged even when also personally committed — tombstoning them could
  not stop the engine validating them from the base lexicon, so they are not
  ejectable (proven: `PERSONAL hestur 50` → "hestur" completion carries the
  flag = false). `TypingSession.buildSuggestions` maps the flag onto every
  NON-verbatim suggestion just before assembly; the verbatim escape-hatch and
  the wave-36 literal-revert slots are `.unknown` (the typed literal) and are
  never flagged — they are the tap-to-learn hatch, not own-learned words.
  `bridge()` threads the flag into the KK suggestion's `additionalInfo` under
  a KK-owned key (`Autocomplete.Suggestion.isPersonalLearnedInfoKey`, value
  "0"/"1"), read back via the fork's `Autocomplete.Suggestion.isPersonalLearned`.
- **KK fork patch (the long-press gesture KK has for keys but NOT for
  suggestion items)** — `Autocomplete+Toolbar.swift`: the tap `Button` that
  wraps each suggestion (`toolbarItemButton`) became a dedicated
  `ToolbarItemButton` view. A normal tap still routes to `suggestionAction`
  (insert). When an injected `Autocomplete.EjectAffordance` is present AND the
  suggestion `isPersonalLearned`, a `.onLongPressGesture` arms an inline
  confirm. Affordance + copy are injected by the host via
  `.autocompleteEjectAffordance(_:)` (new public env value + view modifier in
  `Autocomplete+ToolbarItem.swift`); nil = upstream tap-only behavior, so with
  no host wiring the fork is byte-for-byte the prior toolbar. All copy lives
  in the host (KeyboardKit ships no localization for it) via closures on the
  affordance.
- **Confirm UX — reversible inline two-step pill (NO dark patterns), chosen
  over KK's callout/menu machinery**: long-press arms a red confirm pill in
  that slot — `Fjarlægja „<orð>"?` (`ToolbarItemEjectConfirm`) with an
  explicit ✕ cancel next to the confirm, so removal is never accidental and
  always cancelable. Chosen over a destructive-immediate action (deletion must
  be reversible) and over KK's `Keyboard.Gesture` callout/menu machinery
  (heavy in an extension; the inline pill lives entirely in the button's own
  `@State`). A new keystroke rebuilds the bar → `.onChange(of: suggestion.text)`
  auto-cancels a stale confirm. Copy is Icelandic/warm per the App/Strings
  COPY RULE, in a small new `KeyboardStrings` enum in KeyboardExt (the app's
  `Strings` is a separate target).
- **Eject → tombstone → snapshot refresh (reuses `PersonalModel.remove`, no
  new deletion path)**: the confirm routes to
  `LyklabordAutocompleteService.ejectPersonalWord`, which on the engine
  queue does a coordinated read-modify-write on the App Group model file —
  load `PersonalModel`, `remove(word:)` (drops counts + bigrams, inserts a
  permanent tombstone — deletions stick, existing behavior), save atomically —
  then `forgetSessionWord` (the in-session overlay is not tombstone-aware, so
  a word taught by a verbatim tap this session must be dropped from it too or
  it resurrects) and re-injects the freshly-tombstoned model as the personal
  snapshot so the word leaves the bar immediately. Local file only: no
  network, no new entitlement — the extension-privacy doctrine is intact.
  NOTE (documented asymmetry): the app writes the model file with a plain
  atomic save on the assumption the extension never writes it; the extension
  now does, coordinated — best-effort against a concurrent app compaction (a
  lost tombstone would only let the word return, never crash). `forgetSession`
  added to `PersonalStore`/`TypeEngine`.
- **Harness coverage** (`isPersonalLearned` flag + eject→tombstone→refresh +
  not-ejectable-base rule are all headless; the gesture + inline confirm are
  device-only): new `type-repl` directives `EJECT <word>` (headless twin of
  the service's remove + snapshot refresh: tombstone the seed, drop it from
  the learned set + session overlay, re-apply), `EXPECT_PERSONAL_LEARNED` /
  `EXPECT_NOT_PERSONAL_LEARNED`. 5 new core.scenarios: own-learned completion
  flagged; base-word-committed-personally NOT flagged; verbatim slot never
  flagged; eject removes from the bar AND leaves the typed word uncorrected
  (tombstone sticks); session-learned eject forgets the overlay. 8 new
  `PersonalVocabularyTests` (predicate true/false incl. base-word/tombstone/
  unknown, flag threads through TypingSession, verbatim slot unflagged,
  `forgetSessionWord`, and the full model-path eject:
  `PersonalModel.remove` → snapshot → gone-from-bar). Learning already owns
  the deeper tombstone-sticks coverage (`testTombstonedWordDoesNotRelearn…`,
  `testVerbatimTapDoesNotOverrideTombstone`, `testRemoveTombstoneAllows…`) —
  the eject reuses that exact `remove`.
- **Gates**: TypeEngine `swift test` 454/454 (+8 wave-37); Learning 100/100
  (unchanged; clean rebuild after the checkout moved to
  `Code/LyklabordApp`). Scenario suites all green: core
  158/158 (+5 wave-37), dogfood 46/46, inflect 13/13, touch 11/11, compounds
  22/22. Simulator build green (xcodegen + Debug/iOS-Simulator — compiles the
  KK fork for iOS; the macOS `swift build` of KeyboardKit fails only on
  PRE-EXISTING `#Preview` `(ColorScheme)->Color` ShapeStyle cascades in
  untouched files, not the fork patch). BuildInfo.swift reverted (stamped by
  the build). Personal gate BYTE-IDENTICAL to wave 36 (61 rows, top1 28,
  falseAc 10; slangur 3/3): the one regression `„vold|„cold` is the SAME
  pre-existing force-correction wave 36 flagged, present with this wave off —
  `type-eval personal` replays the corrector directly, bypassing
  `TypingSession` where all this wave's flag code lives. Baseline unchanged.
- **Open (device-only, flag for next dogfood)**: verify live that a
  long-press on an own-learned bar suggestion arms the red `Fjarlægja „orð"?`
  pill (and only on own-learned words — a normal tap still inserts), that
  confirm removes the word from Orðasafn (tombstoned, never silently
  relearned) and it vanishes from the bar immediately, that ✕ / a new
  keystroke cancels, and that the verbatim slot and base words never arm it.
  The gesture + SwiftUI confirm interaction cannot be reproduced headlessly.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 36: backspace reverts autocorrect via a reserved literal slot

- **Trigger**: dogfood session 2026-07-17T21-49-40 — the user typed the
  English word "cold" inside Icelandic quotes, the c→v near-miss produced
  „vold, and the engine force-corrected to „völd (a real IS word, conf 1.0).
  There was no one-tap way back to the literal. The iOS-native reflex on a
  wrong autocorrect is to press backspace; at that moment the bar's left slot
  should offer the ORIGINAL literal so one tap swaps the corrected word back.
  This wave ADDS that escape hatch — it changes no corrector/autocorrect
  decision (the conservatism invariant and the „vold force-correction itself
  are untouched; the personal gate below is byte-identical with the wave
  on/off).
- **Mechanism choice — (a) the reserved slot, backspace deletes normally**
  (the two candidates the brief posed): (a) backspace behaves normally and the
  literal is OFFERED in the reserved left slot for a one-tap full revert, vs
  (b) the first backspace reverts the whole corrected word in one step. Chose
  (a) — it is exactly iOS's behavior AND the cleanest to implement correctly on
  the existing machinery: the autocorrect commit already leaves "word␣" in the
  buffer, so the first backspace simply deletes that trailing delimiter and
  REVEALS the corrected word (an ordinary deletion, no special backspace
  handling), and the only addition is prepending the literal as the reserved
  verbatim/`.unknown` slot when the cursor sits right after that word. (b)
  would have meant a bespoke whole-word delete+reinsert on a keystroke KeyboardKit
  already owns, with cursor-restoration to manage — more surface, no better UX.
  No in-place-swap ambiguity arose, so the (b) fallback the brief allowed was
  not needed.
- **How the memo arms/clears** (mirrors the `pendingContinuationRevert` /
  `setRevertMemoArmed` memo pattern; all in `TypingSession`, shared by device
  and the `type-repl` harness): a one-shot `backspaceRevert = (literal,
  corrected)` arms in `confirm(...)` exactly when the committed form equals the
  AUTOCORRECT the previous bar armed (`committed == lastEmittedAutocorrect`) —
  an engine force-correction, never a manual alternative tap or a verbatim tap.
  The `literal` is the raw pending token (`previousCurrentWord`), byte-exact —
  the same string the proxy-edit ledger's before-window carries, NEVER
  re-derived from the correction (casing/„ quote/accents preserved; proven by
  the Godan→Góðan casing test). `backspaceRevertJustArmed` keeps the slot off
  the commit pass itself, so the reserved slot arms ONLY when the backspace is
  the very next action after the commit (iOS's tight one-shot window). It then
  survives ONLY while the cursor sits right after the corrected word reached BY
  DELETION (`currentWord == corrected && windowShrank`) — a typed continuation,
  a fresh word that happens to equal the corrected form, a second backspace
  into the word, a new commit, a cursor move / field change / external change,
  or consumption all drop it. The reserved slot is the leading verbatim
  suggestion (text = literal) in `buildSuggestions`; `hasArmedLiteralRevert`
  mirrors "the slot is showing" into a lock-guarded flag (`literalRevertArmed`,
  same lock as the revert/attachment memos) so the device tap routes
  synchronously without a queue round-trip.
- **Ledger attribution / not a re-correction** (the brief's explicit
  requirement): the revert is a USER edit, not an engine correction. The proxy
  edit (delete corrected, insert literal) is KeyboardKit's, wrapped by the
  action handler's existing `handle(_ suggestion:)` ledger snapshot, so it is
  attributed as a self-edit — never misread as external, never as an engine
  correction. `revertToLiteral(matching:)` (a) sets `verbatimChoice` to the
  literal so the next delimiter cannot re-correct it (it never arms a fresh
  autocorrect — the restored token being a valid-or-not literal is offered, not
  forced), (b) buffers a `correctionReverted(original:applied:)` event — the
  SAME rejection signal as revert-on-continuation, deliberately NOT a
  wordCommitted/wordTapped hard-learn (a reverted typo is not whitelisted as a
  real word forever — conservatism), and (c) primes `tapLearnedWord` so the
  imminent commit pass doesn't also buffer a commit event. The recorder gets a
  distinct applied kind `"literal-revert"` (SessionRecorder) so the analyzer
  can count force-correction rejections separately from ordinary taps.
- **Scope discipline**: the „vold→„völd AUTO-APPLY needs a saturated IS lane
  the neutral headless harness can't prime (bare "vold" doesn't force-correct
  off-device), so the reliable fyrit→fyrir / hestr→hestur stand in for the IS
  class in the contracts; teh→the covers EN. The device revert of the actual
  „völd→„vold is flagged for the owner's next dogfood (below).
- **Gates**: TypeEngine `swift test` 446/446 (11 new `BackspaceRevertTests`
  driving the memo state machine through a faithful proxy+ledger driver: arm on
  autocorrect commit, slot after backspace, byte-exact restore incl. casing,
  correctionReverted-not-wordCommitted, re-correction suppressed, and the five
  clear paths — valid-word/typed-continuation/second-backspace/cursor-move/
  next-word-overwrite). All scenario suites green: core 153/153 (8 new wave-36
  contracts), dogfood 46/46, inflect 13/13, touch 11/11, compounds 22/22.
  Simulator build green (xcodegen + Debug/iOS-Simulator; BuildInfo not
  re-stamped by this wave). Personal gate: 61 rows top1 28 / falseAc 10 —
  BYTE-IDENTICAL with the wave stashed vs applied (proven: `type-eval personal`
  replays the corrector directly, bypassing `TypingSession` where all this
  wave's code lives). The one gate REGRESSION — `„vold|„cold` new false-ac — is
  the PRE-EXISTING force-correction on a newly-added dogfood row (the exact bug
  this escape hatch serves), present with the wave off; it is a corrector
  concern for a future wave, not this one, and this wave introduces zero
  personal-eval movement. Baseline left unchanged.
- **Open (device-only, flag for next dogfood)**: verify live that after „völd
  auto-applies on device, the first backspace reveals „völd and the reserved
  left slot offers the byte-exact „vold, and one tap restores it — the
  auto-apply itself can't be reproduced headlessly, so the end-to-end revert of
  the real trigger case is owed a device check. Also confirm the reserved slot
  renders visually as the quoted `.unknown` type at the LEFT of the toolbar
  (the mapping is `.unknown` → quoted title, same as the verbatim slot).

## 2026-07-17 — Cold-start hardening (KeyboardExt)

- **Trigger**: keyboard-extension cold launch is the moment a user judges the
  product — if the engine isn't ready before the first keystroke, the bar is
  empty and it feels broken. No instrumentation existed to measure it.
- **Decided**: (1) the serial engine queue QoS goes `.utility` →
  `.userInitiated` — still fully off-main (`viewDidLoad` only enqueues the
  loader; no mmap open or file I/O on the UI thread), but `.utility` was
  wrong for work the user is actively waiting to see in the suggestion bar,
  especially under system contention at launch. (2) Privacy-safe OS
  signposts + log milestones (subsystem `com.supermassiveapps.lyklabord`, category
  `AutocompleteColdStart`): bootstrap queued/started, engine ready, first
  autocomplete pass, first non-empty result. **No proxy text or suggestion
  content is ever logged** — milestones only, upholding the zero-telemetry
  doctrine (these are on-device os_log/signpost, not network).
- **Gates**: sim build green; TypeEngine 435/435; release bench p50 1.30 ms /
  p95 3.59 ms / max 6.10 ms (first-five max 1.69 ms) — the QoS change did not
  regress per-keystroke latency. Package cache rebuilt after the repo move
  (the checkout moved to `Code/LyklabordApp`).
- **Open**: real-device cold-launch measurement still owed — filter Console/
  Instruments for `AutocompleteColdStart`, measure keyboard-presentation →
  "Engine ready" → first non-empty result across several fresh extension
  launches (signposts exist precisely to make this a Points-of-Interest read).

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 30: deep-decode mash recovery (the eotthbap→eitthvað class)

- **Trigger**: fast-typing mashes with ≥2 adjacent-key substitutions the live
  keyboard could not reach, all user-confirmed: eotthbap→eitthvað (session
  2026-07-16T22-45-30: o→i, b→v, p→ð), tilsbæðrum→tilsvörum
  (2026-07-17T12-09-21: b→v, æ→ö + extra ð), heipina→heiðina
  (2026-07-17T12-04-13: p→ð). The design hint going in was beam continuity —
  the live recording shows "eitth" ac:true conf 1.0 mid-word, lost as the
  tail arrived.
- **Beam-continuity assessment (design A) — evaluated and REJECTED, with
  evidence**: the boundary search already reaches the whole class under
  static pricing — the TAPLESS replay auto-fires eotthbap→eitthvað (3 × 1.02
  nats, inside the deep beam's caps) and heipina→heiðina (single 1.02-nat
  sub), and both personal-baseline rows already PASSED top-1. What the live
  keyboard lost was not search state but per-tap cost headroom: with the
  real coordinates the SAME decode prices o→i 1.62, b→v 2.83, p→ð 8.00
  (capped) = 12.45 nats against a 5.0 multi-edit cap. "eitth" survived
  mid-word only because the prefix needed just the one leaning-tap sub;
  persisting beam state would have persisted the same overpriced tail.
  Root cause is PRICING, in two shapes, plus one genuine search gap:
  1. the per-tap LLR (tight TSI σ) taxes even taps that LEAN toward the
     intended key ABOVE the static geometry price (a tap 78% of the way to
     the i boundary priced o→i 1.62 vs 1.02 static) — harmless on 1-sub
     words, fatal in the multi-sub regime where the taxes compound;
  2. both p→ð cases carry a tap AT p's center (conf 0.99) — a motor-plan
     aim error onto the neighbour of an Icelandic-only edge key (ð sits
     right of p, outside the QWERTY motor map), about which the tap point
     carries no information (the v→ð precedent, spatial edition);
  3. tilsvörum (2 subs + indel = 6.04 nats) is structurally outside the 5.0
     multi-edit cap even tapless — the only piece that needed more search.
- **Decided — three bounded pieces (refined design B)**:
  (1) **Near-miss enabling cap** (`tapNearMissMinLean` 0.25,
  `tapNearMissCapEnabled`): a tap whose within-key offset projects ≥ 0.25
  key pitches along the direction to the intended key caps that
  substitution's per-tap price at the STATIC cost — a supporting tap must
  never price a substitution worse than no coordinates at all (that is what
  "near-misses enable" means); the same predicate exempts the position from
  the margin-veto aggregate (a supporting tap cannot simultaneously
  contradict the rewrite). Dead-center and wrong-direction taps keep the
  full LLR — the veto half untouched (all dead-center scenarios unchanged).
  (2) **Edge-key undershoot carve-out** (`edgeUndershootEnabled`,
  `SpatialModel.edgeUndershootPairs`): the DIRECTIONAL pairs p→ð, l→æ, æ→ö,
  m→þ (typed the left neighbour of a rightmost-column Icelandic-only key)
  price at the static geometry cost per-tap and skip the veto — the same
  carve-out shape the orthographic confusions already have, on the
  structural rule (Icelandic-only edge keys) rather than a point fix; two
  independent confirmed sessions attest the p→ð member. Static/tapless
  pricing untouched (the pairs are adjacent, ~1.02 nats, already).
  (3) **Mash-recovery widened cone** (`mashRecoveryEnabled`, cap 6.5, gate
  5.5, min length 6): when the deep decode runs AND the pool holds no
  attested candidate under 5.5 (above the 6.0 auto-apply cost ceiling — the
  bar would be essentially empty), the multi-edit cost cap rises 5.0 → 6.5,
  admitting the 2-subs+indel shape. **Offer-only suppression, learned from
  the dev A/B**: the first cut leaked 4 wrong fires in the 5.0–6.0 band
  (raðvherfa→"ráðherra", cloours→"clouds", HHatley→"Harley",
  Yktzchak→"Yitzhak") — candidates only the widened cone admitted, firing
  through margins calibrated for the narrow cone. Rule: a winner only the
  recovery run pooled, whose exact DP cost exceeds `beamMultiEditCostCap`,
  never auto-applies (widening the search fills an empty bar with offers;
  it must not widen the calibrated set of auto-applies). With the rule, the
  wave REMOVES 2 dev false-acs net (two pre-existing wrong fires — a
  Bkrtíngur accent guess and an "eve enters" split — die because the cone
  surfaces better readings).
- **The three cases after the wave** (real recorded taps, repl-verified):
  eotthbap→eitthvað AUTO-FIRES (cost 3.06 = static, margin ∞, veto factor
  1.0 — every sub tap-supported); heipina→heiðina AUTO-FIRES (1.02, margin
  11.4, "yfir heiðina" bigram relief); tilsbæðrum→tilsvörum OFFERED at
  slot 2 behind verbatim, auto-apply structurally blocked (6.04 >
  autocorrectMaxSpatialCost 6.0) — exactly the offer-not-force doctrine.
  Tapless (personal corpus) tilsbæðrum|tilsvörum flips to top-1.
- **Gates**: dev 2339 top-1 / 119 false-ac vs 2339/121 wave-off (top-1
  byte-identical to waves 23/31/32, false-ac DOWN 2, ac-fired −0.07pp);
  heldout (once) 2281/160 vs 2285/163 (top-1 −4 = −0.13pp within the 0.2pp
  gate; false-ac DOWN 3 — the recovery cone kills a Kanters→"Mangers" fire
  and a "Gu actually" split fire); compounds corpus 209/666, 19 false-ac
  (baseline 208/19 — one row improved, none regressed); personal gate 54
  rows top1 27 falseAc 9 — zero regressions, tilsbæðrum|tilsvörum newly
  passing, slangur 3/3 unforced (ofpeppast/kozy), baseline updated;
  scorecard PASS (micro 166/167, false-ac 0, valid-word safety green,
  scenarios 237/237); suites ×3 green (6 new wave-30 contracts: the three
  real-tap cases, dead-center ofpeppast/kozy counters, valid "skip" never
  becomes "skið" despite the cheap edge pair); swift test 435 green (13 new
  MashRecoveryTests). **Latency**: bench p50/p95 unchanged (~1.2/3–5 ms,
  within run-to-run noise); the widened cone costs +3–4 ms ONLY on
  empty-pool mash keystrokes (koetip-class stress worst 5.5 → 9.5 ms,
  each decode still hard-capped by the existing 6 ms `beamTimeBudget`);
  worst observed mash keystroke with real taps ~27 ms under heavy machine
  contention, gate 30 passes with margin on a quiet run (max 4.5–6.6 ms).
  New knobs `tapNearMissMinLean`/`tapNearMissCapEnabled`/
  `edgeUndershootEnabled`/`mashRecoveryEnabled`/`mashRecoveryCostCap`/
  `mashRecoveryGate`/`mashRecoveryMinLength` in the A/B allowlist.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 31: compound guard hardening + Miðeind eval integration

- **Trigger**: the mideind-compound-cases harvest (research/
  mideind-compound-cases.{md,jsonl} — 2,052 curated rows: 18 valid
  compounds, 14 rejected pseudo-compounds, 2,020 real error→correction
  pairs from iceErrorCorpus CC BY 4.0 + GreynirCorrect MIT) exposed four
  named gaps against wave 22's Compounds.swift: no negative curation
  (margskonar class), a 2-modifier ceiling vs real 4-part compounds, zero
  missing-hyphen coverage (812 rows, the largest class), and unverified
  linking-letter repair reach.
- **Eval integration** — `data/eval/compounds.jsonl` (666 rows, replayable
  by `type-eval corpus compounds`, its own scorecard key — dev.jsonl keeps
  historical comparability): 250 compound_collocation (corrector targets,
  typo verified engine-INVALID through the real artifacts — doctrine:
  valid words are never corrector targets), 106 missing_hyphen (pure
  hyphen-insertion shapes), 10 wrongly_joined (the deny set), and two
  STRUCTURAL-GAP trackers replayed as context=[A] typo=B (100
  missing_hyphen_spaced, 200 wrongly_split) whose token B is verified
  VALID — the engine has no cross-token join machinery, so top-1 is
  honestly 0 and any fire is a false-ac: they double as protection
  assertions (both sit at 0 falseAc). Deterministic generator
  (`data/eval/generate-compounds-eval.py`) with shape-purity filters
  (TEI alignment noise: corpus rows whose "correction" also changed
  inflection or carried its own typo — Westminister-höll — are dropped).
  IceEC attribution added to data/ATTRIBUTION.md. Baseline scorecard
  line: 208/666 top-1, 19 false-ac (collocation 158/250 + 7fa,
  missing_hyphen 40/106 + 12fa, wrongly_joined 10/10 + 0fa).
- **Never-a-compound deny set** (Compounds.swift `neverCompounds`, the 10
  harvested GreynirCorrect C002 joined→split forms): `split(of:)` refuses
  them outright. KEY ARTIFACT FINDING: BÍN's descriptive coverage
  actually ATTESTS 8 of the 10 as whole surface forms (margskonar
  carries a full indeclinable-adjective paradigm; annarstaðar, niðrá,
  afþvíað are BÍN adverb entries) — so lexicon validity, not compound
  analysis, is what protects them, the conservatism invariant stands,
  and the deny set is a structural guard (compound layer can never ADD
  protection, e.g. for variants BÍN lacks). The user-visible half is a
  wrong-form-offer-style bar entry: the canonical split ("margs konar")
  is OFFERED, never auto-applied — one tap writes standard orthography.
  At the time, the 2 non-attested deny words (fjögurhundruð,
  níuhundruð) auto-split via the ordinary space-miss machinery (margin
  inf), locked by scenario. The 2026-07-18 BÍN refresh now attests both;
  the valid-form invariant therefore makes their canonical split an
  offer-only correction, and the scenario was updated with the artifact.
  wrongly_joined eval category at this wave: 10/10 top-1, 0 false-ac.
- **3-modifier decision — cap stays 2, measured**: the scan is
  generalized behind `compoundMaxModifiers` (A/B-able knob, recursion
  preserves wave 22's fewest-parts/shortest-first order byte-for-byte at
  2). Of the 16 single-token harvested valid compounds, 15 already
  resolve at ≤2 modifiers because BÍN attests intermediate compounds
  whole (gervigreindar+gagnaverin — BOTH halves are single BÍN units;
  gauks+staða+málið lands without tantum demotion; the feared 4-part
  ceiling mostly dissolves). Cap 3 gains exactly ONE word —
  álfa+brunn+fugla+garðurinn, Miðeind's constructed tokenizer stress
  pick — and is byte-identical on dev AND the compounds corpus. Zero
  measured gain doesn't justify widening the accidental-decomposition
  surface wave 22 deliberately bounded. The remaining failure
  (síamskattarkjólanna) is modifier-legality (lemma-freq floor), not
  depth. Only real residue: protection scenario locks
  gervigreindargagnaverin.
- **Linking-letter yield** (the framhaldskóla class — the most repeated
  real error in the harvest, and the honest answer to (e)): eldneyti→
  eldsneyti already fired via the ordinary insert pass (verified,
  scenario-locked), but framhaldskóla did NOT — the typo accidentally
  decomposes (framhald+skóla is a legal reading) and wave 22's
  protection silenced the attested repair. New rule: protection yields
  when the winner is is.lex-attested and equals the typed word with one
  bandstafur (s/a/r/u) inserted at — or removed just before — the
  decomposition boundary (framhaldsskóla +s; samferðafólki −r), after
  which every ordinary gate (margin, typicality, junk scaling) still
  applies. Boundary-strict: kaffispjallið inserts -l- at position 10,
  not at the kaffis|pjalið boundary — wave 22's offer-only verdict
  stands there (counter-scenario). Dev: +2 ac-fired, both correct
  (top-1/false-ac ±0.00).
- **Missing-hyphen decision** (812 harvested rows): full cross-token
  hyphen repair ("Silverstone brautinni", "fjármála og efnahags-
  ráðherra" coordination) is a join-machinery wave of its own —
  DEFERRED with the gap tracked at 0% in missing_hyphen_spaced. But the
  joined single-token shape got a cheap high-precision repair: the
  space-miss split already finds the boundary (and was auto-applying
  the two-word reading "Gucci buxurnar" — 39.5% false-ac on the
  category), so when the typed token leads with a capital, P(IS) ≥ 0.5,
  the first half is NOT BÍN-known (foreign modifier — "Íslandsog" keeps
  its plain split) and the second half has a BÍN noun/adjective reading,
  the split renders with the standard orthographic hyphen
  (Gucci-buxurnar, ritreglur foreign-modifier rule). Render-only: the
  hypothesis, score and auto-apply decision are the split machinery's.
  Category: 0% → 37.7% top-1, false-ac 39.5% → 11.3% (residue is
  diacritic-mismatch halves like Barbari/Barbarí and lowercase-typed
  rows the capital gate correctly skips). Typed "Porsche-bílunum" was
  verified unmangleable (hyphenated tokens generate no candidates at
  all) and is scenario-locked.
- **Heldout honesty**: the first heldout run exposed an UNGATED hyphen
  render regressing EN space-miss rows (en false-ac +3): the lane gate
  (P(IS) ≥ 0.5) and the noun-head requirement came from that
  mechanism-level finding — two further heldout consults verified the
  fix at mechanism granularity (no row inspection; dev stayed
  byte-identical throughout). Final heldout: 2285/163 vs 2287/162
  (top-1 −2, false-ac +1, top-3 +3; en false-ac FLAT at 111) — the
  residue is two genuine merged-token repairs now rendered with the
  orthographic hyphen where the Wikipedia source wrote the pair
  unhyphenated: a style-variant miss on a real typo fix, not a
  valid-word destruction. Documented rather than tuned away.
- **Gates**: dev 2339 top-1 / 121 false-ac — byte-identical to waves
  23/32 (wave-off A/B: top-1/false-ac ±0.00, ac-fired +0.07pp = the 2
  correct linking-yield fires); knobs-off equals the committed baseline
  exactly (split() refactor proven inert); heldout above; compounds
  baseline 208/666, history line noted "wave 31 compound hardening";
  scorecard PASS (micro 166/167, false-ac 0, valid-word safety green,
  scenarios 231/231); personal gate 54 rows top1 26 falseAc 9 — zero
  regressions, baseline unchanged; suites ×3 green (11 new wave-31
  contracts); swift test 422 TypeEngine + 20 LemmaCore green (6 new
  CompoundTests); bench steady worst ~7.5 ms (gate 30; one cold-cache
  54 ms spike absorbed by the scorecard retry, known pattern). New
  knobs `compoundMaxModifiers`, `compoundLinkingRepairYieldEnabled`,
  `hyphenJoinRepairEnabled` in the A/B allowlist; repl `:compound`
  probe.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 32: archaic-twin restoration (the eg/þu class)

- **Trigger**: the single most recurring silent miss across all 13 dogfood
  sessions: eg/Eg committed silently in 5+ recordings ("en stundum tek eg",
  "og veitingar boði eg", …), filed under restoration-fold/watch in the
  top-gaps table. Working hypothesis going in: "eg" is BÍN-valid (archaic
  register form of ég), so the conservatism invariant protects it.
- **Artifact verification KILLED the premise** (repl `:word` probes + a
  direct scan of BÍN's SHsnid.csv, 6.3M rows): the Sigrúnarsnið BÍN
  distribution carries NO archaic eg/þu/nu/tva/sa/jeg forms at all, so
  bin-morph.bin never knew them; is.lex's junk filter additionally dropped
  their web-corpus attestations (eg 6359, sa 10516, þvi 38 in the raw
  unigrams — all absent from the shipped lexicon). The class actually
  splits three ways in the shipped chain:
  1. skeletons attested NOWHERE (eg, þu, su, mikid, þo): ordinary-unknown
     path, no veto exists — everything already fired at HEAD **except
     "þu"**, whose twin þú (z +1.482) sat 0.02σ under the short-token
     headline floor (`autocorrectShortMinZ` 1.5);
  2. skeletons attested in en.lex only (nu −0.66, sa −0.00, ut −0.20,
     for +2.35): valid typed words — the skeleton-collision triple gate
     already fires them inside a running IS lane (sletta guard log-odds
     +4.7 for nu at P(IS) 0.9). THIS is the real eg-vs-sa asymmetry the
     dogfood data hinted at: en.lex attestation, not BÍN validity;
  3. skeletons that are genuine is.lex vocabulary (ja 13462 vs já 71404 —
     ratio 5.3, vist/víst, för/for): dominance-ratio (10x) keeps them
     protected. NOT this wave's class, verified untouched.
- **Twin-pair sweep** (unigrams.json.gz × SHsnid forms × en-80k): 4835
  acute-fold pairs with a somewhere-valid skeleton. Structure: (i)
  is.lex-attested junk skeletons (þvi 143074:1, þa 41015:1, frá 21852:1 —
  all fire today via the 10x ratio gate); (ii) BÍN-only skeletons of
  headline twins (malinu/málinu 285k:floor, seð/séð, nyta/nýta — fire via
  `restorationDominanceMinZ`/oblique); (iii) en.lex-attested skeletons
  (class 2 above); (iv) nowhere-attested (class 1). The only 2-char twins
  in the (1.17, 1.5) z-band reachable from a nowhere-attested skeleton:
  þú +1.48 (the target); next admits down are fé +1.17 and já +1.12,
  both excluded by attested skeletons ("fe"/"ja") before any floor runs.
- **Decided — ratio-gated probe reuse, NO curated allowlist**: (1)
  **archaic-twin short floor**: a restoration-only winner that IS the
  typed skeleton's dominant acute-fold twin (the wave-26
  `acuteFoldShadowTwin` probe — 10x is.lex dominance over the skeleton's
  own attestation, above-noise twin, twin beats the skeleton's ENGLISH
  reading) clears `archaicTwinShortMinZ` 1.3 instead of the 1.5 headline
  bar. The probe's three gates separate the classes cleanly on the real
  artifacts, so an allowlist adds nothing the data doesn't already say;
  1.3 bisects the þú/fé band with ~0.15σ safety both ways. Blast radius =
  exactly þu→þú (mid-lane margin 1.026 ≥ 0.5 relaxed; fresh-field 1.241 ≥
  1.15 ordinary — both now fire). Dev/heldout byte-identical (the
  synthetic corpus has no such pairs — wave-26-style inertness). (2)
  **Single-letter wave-26 parity**: the a→á/i→í path still consulted RAW
  `isPersonalValid` — an IMPLICITLY learned lazy "a" (the dogfood "horfa
  a mynd" shape: habitual accentless typing teaches the engine the
  skeleton) silently disarmed the flagship single-letter restoration.
  Now `isPersonalProtected` (shadow demotion) on both the IS bare-vowel
  gate and the EN lone-i mirror; explicit adds, verbatim taps and
  tombstones keep full veto exactly as before.
- **Deliberateness verified end-to-end** (scenarios): one tap on the
  quoted verbatim slot is a session-immediate EXPLICIT learn — the next
  "eg" commits as typed with ég still offered (poetry stays typeable and
  re-protectable); PERSONAL_EXPLICIT seeds keep the veto; implicit seeds
  keep restoring (wave-26 continuity).
- **Device forensics — honest open finding**: the recordings show the
  ENGINE (raw `recordPass` bar) arming ac=false for Eg/eg/a in sessions
  where su→sú and ætla DID arm, and the device's app-group container has
  NO personal-model.json (devicectl-verified via the pre-migration
  group.is.lyklabord container), yet the harness at the same stamped
  commit with the recorded context AND tap coordinates fires eg→ég at
  margin 2.98 vs required 0.35. No session state constructible in the
  harness reproduces the silence; both device builds are "+dirty"
  stamps. Suspects, in order: process-lifetime explicit session-learns
  (a verbatim tap on "eg"/"a" any time in the keyboard process's life —
  invisible to the recordings, which only capture armed sessions) or a
  stale/divergent installed appex. Next device install must re-verify
  the class live before this wave is declared closed on-device.
- **för/for safety proof**: "for" is BÍN-valid (form of för) + en.lex
  headline — `isValidTypedWord` true, so the archaic-twin path (which
  only exists inside the typed-invalid branch) structurally cannot touch
  it; its deep-IS-lane for→fór fire remains the separate grammar-vouched
  skeleton-collision class (dominance-minZ: fór +1.77). Scenario-locked:
  för never rewritten, for keeps its English reading at neutral, ja keeps
  dominance protection, nu fires only through the triple gate.
- **Personal-data hygiene** (waves 23/27 precedent, kb.jsonl-verified):
  corrected Eg|ég → Eg|Ég (capitalization transfer — the engine's answer
  for typed "Eg" IS "Ég"; the analyzer had lowercased the intent;
  key-preserving in-place edit, durable across aggregate re-runs) and
  registered Eg→Ég + lg→og in confirmed-intents. Five further rows are
  IN-FLIGHT FRAGMENTS backspaced before any commit (ciyu|ciyt, log|og,
  su|stundum, æyla|tæ, tæ|að — kb.jsonl shows every one dissolved by
  backspaces mid-word; replaying them with a delimiter manufactures
  false-acs the sessions never had, the wave-23 "a|Arnj" class). The
  first drop attempt did NOT stick: `aggregate.py` re-adds any
  CORRECTOR_CLASSES event whose (typo,intended) key is absent, and an
  aggregate re-ran mid-wave — so the four manufactured false-ac rows are
  instead baked into the baseline as KNOWN artifacts (non-gating for
  future waves). **Flag for the analyzer owner** (tools/ is outside this
  wave's scope): MISS_ABSENT/MISS_OFFERED events should check kb.jsonl
  for an actual delimiter commit of the typo token before promotion —
  the never-committed-fragment rule wave 23 applied by hand.
- **Gates**: dev 2339 top-1 / 121 false-ac — byte-identical to wave 23
  (A/B toggle on-vs-off: ±0.00 everywhere); heldout (once) 2287/162 —
  byte-identical; scorecard PASS (micro 166/167, false-ac 0, valid-word
  safety green); personal gate 54 rows top1 26 falseAc 9 (4 of the 9 =
  the manufactured fragment rows above) — ZERO regressions, improvements
  include eg|ég newly passing top-1, baseline updated; scenarios 220/220
  ×3 (14 new wave-32 contracts incl. mikid→mikið locking the d↔ð
  analog); swift test 416 green (7 new ArchaicTwinTests); bench worst
  5.9 ms scorecard run (gate 30). New knobs
  `archaicTwinRestorationEnabled` / `archaicTwinShortMinZ` in the A/B
  allowlist.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 23: case-aware long-word completions (split-case governors)

- **Trigger**: the flagship INFLECTION_MISS (session 2026-07-16T15-32-25):
  typing "…dundra okkur á Kirkjubæjars" toward "Kirkjubæjarklaustur", the
  bar's ONLY klaustur form was the dative "Kirkjubæjarklaustri" — is.lex
  frequency (2570 vs 570) decides the completion pool, and "á" governs BOTH
  þgf location (0.522) and þf motion (0.257), so guessing one case starves
  the bar of the other. Plus wave 22's deferral: compound completions built
  but OFF pending completion-specific pricing. Live session
  2026-07-17T12-04-13 landed mid-wave as extra targets (ellilífeyrisþegi
  rank 31/31, Þórðarson ~24, heiðn→heiðina absent).
- **Decided — ranking-only, margin-free** (completions are bar offers; the
  conservatism invariant is untouched): (1) **Governed prefix-repair
  completions** (pass 3c, OOV + governor + length ≥ 5): complete the
  trimmed prefixes (trim 1; 2 at length ≥ 8 — 2-char trims on short tokens
  walked "segir and…" continuations over the honest "Andyu"→Andy deletion)
  plus the governor's bigram-attested continuations that extend a trimmed
  prefix ("yfir heiðina" f=232 sits below the frequency cut of the "heið"
  range — usage evidence must not lose to the frequency pool). (2)
  **Speculative completion channel**: match/extra-typed/omitted only — NO
  substitutions, learned the hard way: the first cut priced sub+complete
  composites ("hveru" → sub u→j + "um" ≈ 2 nats) under honest single-edit
  repairs and cost 9 dev top-1 rows (the wave-22 fold-priced-twin lesson,
  completion edition); final channel = residue at the indel constants
  (gemination discounts kept) + 0.5/char extension, min'd with the
  ordinary DP. Speculative admissions are EXCLUDED from every pass-gating
  probe (bestSoFar/bestAttestedCost) — they widen the bar, never the pass
  decisions. (3) **Case-sibling expansion** (pass 3d): a pooled completion
  with UNAMBIGUOUS lemma attribution (surface-form doctrine — ambiguous
  lemma keeps the attested surface only) contributes paradigm siblings in
  the governor's supported cases — dominant + runner-up when P(second) ≥
  0.2 (á/yfir are genuinely split; frá 0.149 is not) — number/definiteness
  held fixed; a split-case COMPANION rule at assembly seats the other case
  form directly behind its sibling ("Kirkjubæjar|" at device limit 3:
  klaustri top, klaustur right behind). Morph fit extends to speculative
  completions; exact-bigram override still wins.
- **Compound completions SHIPPED** (the wave-22 deferral): priced at
  compoundCompletionBasePenalty 3.0 + 0.5/char (a hypothesized
  decomposition ≥ the split-substitution tier, never the raw completion
  shortcut that structurally outbid splits), ranked within the pool by
  head attestation (0.25 × z, floored at compoundHeadMinZ so bound
  suffixes aren't punished) + the head's case fit, and a HARD assembly
  rule: every space-miss split reading ranks above every compound
  extension ("fimmtabókin" keeps "fimmta bókin" first, contract
  scenarioed). Dev A/B on-vs-off: top-1/false-ac/ac-fired ±0.00, top-3
  −1 row — the offer is essentially free now.
- **Live targets after the wave** (repl, real artifacts): "á Kirkjubæjars"
  bar = skóla, Kirkjubæjar, klaustri, klaustur (both cases, limit 5);
  "yfir heiðn" surfaces heiðina (#7/8 wide bar — strict completions of the
  literal prefix honestly lead), next keystroke "yfir heiði" → heiðina
  TOP with þgf companion heiðinni; "var ellil|" → ellilífeyrisþegi #7 (was
  31/31); "Þorðarason" → Þórðarson now auto-applies top-1. Honest residue:
  klaustur forms still miss the device limit-3 bar at the "Kirkjubæjars"
  state (two cheaper honest candidates lead); the one dev top-1 loss is
  "opinbeir"→opinberi displaced by "opinbera" (genuine "hinn opinbera"
  corpus usage — a toss-up we accept).
- **BÍN casing findings**: paradigms.bin DOES carry place names and
  patronymics, lowercased like bin-morph.bin ("kirkjubæjarklaustur" full
  paradigm nf/þf=klaustur þgf=klaustri ef=klausturs; "þórðarson" is.lex
  f=25745 + BÍN nf/þf) — typed-capitalization transfer (TypeEngine
  leading-cap rule) covers casing end-to-end, verified in the session bars.
- **Personal-data hygiene** (wave-27 precedent): corrected the pipeline's
  mis-guessed row heipina|heiðn → heipina|heiðina (the intent chain and
  final session text both say heiðina — the engine's p→ð+completion fire
  now matches it, registered in confirmed-intents) and DROPPED the
  malformed "a|Arnj" row (an in-flight fragment backspaced before any
  commit — kb.jsonl shows applied:none throughout; replaying it with a
  delimiter manufactures a false-ac the session never had).
- **Gates**: dev 2339 top-1 / 121 false-ac vs 2340/122 (−0.03pp top-1,
  within the 0.2pp gate; false-ac DOWN 1; ac-fired −4); heldout (once)
  2287/162 vs 2288/162 (false-ac FLAT, top-1 −1, top-3 −1); scorecard
  PASS (micro 166/167, false-ac 0, valid-word safety green); personal
  gate 41 rows top1 22 falseAc 4 — zero
  regressions, 12 improvements (new-session rows), baseline updated;
  scenarios 206/206 ×3 (7 new: flagship both-case contract, companion at
  device limit, heiði→heiðina top, heiðn wide-bar contract, no-governor
  byte-parity, stökklei→stökkleikur, fimmtabókin split precedence);
  swift test 409 green (7 new CaseCompletionTests: split/decided
  supported-cases, no-sub channel pricing, paradigm-only sibling lift,
  ambiguity veto, governor-off inertness); bench worst ~4.6 ms (gate 30).

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 27: context-ranking (bigram evidence at ranking/margin time)

- **Trigger**: the largest tracked class in the session-analyzer top-gaps
  table (9 real findings): the intended word is GENERATED but outranked or
  under-margined exactly where the previous word's bigram should decide.
  Named targets: gret→grét ("son minn ég gret": grét led on the "ég grét"
  bigram but sat 0.469 nats over the runner-up against the 0.5 restoration
  margin — the blocker was the completion "greta", morph-BOOSTED +1.19 nats
  because "ég" is a governor and greta fits nominative, while grét's EXACT
  bigram evidence earned no extra weight); vli→false "vil" fire (z +1.48,
  margin 2.7 over junk — but "en" does not select vil: contextual lift
  −0.18σ); mew→með absent from the bar; habb→hann (wave 24's fix) to
  protect.
- **Decided — one currency, four seams**: contextual LIFT = z(w|prev) − z(w)
  in the lane language (calibrated σ; sign ≈ PMI — "ég grét" +1.26σ, "en
  vil" −0.18σ, unattested pairs are nil, never negative evidence).
  (1) **Fold-twin bigram context backoff**: a previous word attested in
  neither lexicon reads bigrams through its dominant acute-fold twin
  (eg→ég via the wave-26 `acuteFoldShadowTwin` gates) — diacritics are an
  input method, for the context word too. Dev-inert (synthetic contexts are
  attested); it is what makes the raw-context personal replay of "Eg gret"
  rank grét at all. (2) **Bigram-dominance margin relief**: winner lift ≥
  0.75σ and a lift-less (unattested or ≤ 0) runner-up → required margin
  ×0.7. Junk-tier winners excluded — the junk margin scaling stands.
  Sweeps: minLift 0.5 leaked 2 false fires, relief at 0.7 adds 6 correct /
  1 false on dev (~86%, the historical margin-band precision). (3)
  **Context-backed 3-char discipline**: an error-class rewrite of a
  3-letter token WITH a present previous word needs winner z ≥ 1.5 unless
  lift ≥ 0.25 vouches (vil +1.48/−0.18 blocked; eru +2.51, það +2.82, vel
  +1.97 fire; "krakkarnir eru" lift +1.16 would fire even sub-floor).
  Floor-off leaked 3 false of 6 fires (50% — bad band); 1.75 removed 3
  correct fires. No-context tokens (sentence-initial, fixtures) keep the
  pre-wave rules — the rule is "the context was consulted and declined to
  vouch". Restoration-only winners exempt (own gate stack). (4)
  **Bigram-continuation proposals** (3-4 char unknown tokens only):
  followers of the fold-backed previous word, shape-prefiltered (same
  first letter or restoration twin, length ±1), z ≥ 1.0 (the double-sub
  context tier), channel cost ≤ 5.5 — context proposes, the typed keys
  verify. The only path to a word outside every short edit budget ("en
  vli" → væri = insert-r + l→æ; væri sits rank 300–450 in "en"'s fan-out,
  hence pool 500). Follower scan memoized per context word
  (ContinuationProposalCache) — warm cost ~0, one cold 20k-row scan can
  spike (measured 40 ms once; warmUp + scorecard cold-retry absorb it).
  UNRESTRICTED the pass cost dev top-1 −0.17pp (bigram-supported
  near-followers outranked honest repairs on long tokens) — short-only +
  z floor brought the whole wave to −0.03pp.
- **Honesty**: mew→með stays a bar miss — w→ð is 9 keys apart (spatial 8
  nats); pricing a w→ð confusion from ONE observation is a point fix,
  declined (and mew is en.lex-attested, so it commits as typed under the
  invariant regardless). vli: the false fire is dead (the REQUIRED half),
  væri surfaces in the bar. gret: fires in the typed line (lane 0.88);
  the raw-context eval replay ranks grét top-1 unforced (lane barely
  primed — offering, not forcing, is right there). Corrected the
  pipeline's mis-guessed personal row gret|gert → gret|grét ("Eg gret og
  gret." = grét, the next sentence's "get gert" had leaked into the
  guess) and registered the confirmed intent.
- **Gates**: dev 2340 top-1 / 122 false-ac vs 2341/123 (−0.03pp top-1,
  within the 0.2pp gate; false-ac DOWN 1); heldout (once) 2288/162 vs
  2289/162 (false-ac flat, top-3 +4); personal gate 29 rows top1 16
  falseAc 4 (was 15/28, falseAc 5) — the vli row flipped falseAc→safe,
  zero regressions, baseline updated; scenarios 199/199 ×3 (7 new dogfood:
  both fixed targets, the habb guard, the mew honesty contract, and 3
  counters — vrl→vel mid-tier 3-char still fires, gwrt→gert wins after ég
  despite grét's bigram, greta verbatim untouched); swift test 402 green;
  bench warm max ~3.5 ms (category worst ~4.5 ms, gate 30). Tooling: repl
  `:bigram <prev> <w>` probe + `TypeEngine.bigramDiagnostics`.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 29 phase 2: personal gate, slangur registry, pIS recording

- **Trigger**: wave 29's phase-2 queue — personal-eval as a hard wave gate
  (wave 26's learning self-poisoning was byte-identical on the synthetic dev
  corpus; only a personal snapshot reproduced it), a registry check for
  confirmed-intentional slangur (kozy-class), and recording the engine's own
  lane posterior alongside real typing sessions.
- **Decided**: `type-eval personal` (EvalKit `PersonalEval.swift` +
  type-eval `Personal.swift`) replays `tools/session-analyzer/
  personal-eval.jsonl` (gitignored, real confirmed typing) keyed per-row by
  `typo|intended` (lowercased) against `scores/personal-baseline.json`
  (also gitignored — derived from personal text). Gate: (a) a baseline
  top-1 pass that fails now is a REGRESSION; (b) any NEW false-autocorrect —
  including on a brand-new row — is a REGRESSION (false-ac stays the most-
  guarded metric, held even for rows with no baseline history); (c) new or
  newly-passing rows are improvements, listed but non-gating.
  `--update-baseline` rewrites the baseline after a wave is accepted. A
  missing personal-eval.jsonl (fresh checkout, CI) is a clean no-op, exit 0
  — the gate is only as available as the local personal data, by design.
  Same command additionally loads `confirmed-intents.jsonl`'s
  `intentional: true` rows and replays each at a NEUTRAL lane posterior (no
  priming context — the most permissive the engine ever runs a keystroke
  in), asserting no forced auto-apply; a failure is its own regression
  (false-positive class), independent of the baseline.
- **pIS recording**: `SessionRecorder.recordPass` gained an optional
  `pIcelandic` parameter; `LyklabordAutocompleteService` threads
  `session.probabilityIcelandic` (the same accessor `type-repl`'s `P(IS)`
  prints) through on every pass. Encoded as `pIS` (3 decimals) in
  `kb.jsonl`, omitted (not `null`) when absent — Swift's synthesized
  `Encodable` calls `encodeIfPresent` for `Optional` properties, verified
  with a throwaway encode. `analyze.py`'s `KBRecord` construction reads
  fields via `dict.get(...)` one at a time (no `**r` splat) — confirmed by
  reading it (read-only; the analyzer itself is another agent's scope this
  wave) — so the new key is additive and silently ignored until the
  analyzer opts in.
- **Gates**: established the initial baseline against commit `24d7ec0e`:
  25 personal rows, top-1 13/25, autocorrected 14, falseAc 4 — matches the
  discipline note above (these rows are drawn FROM real corrector misses,
  so a lower top-1 rate than the synthetic corpus is expected, not a
  regression). Slangur check 1/1 (kozy survives unforced). 13 new unit
  tests (EvalKitTests/PersonalEvalTests.swift) against a fixture baseline
  and a DictLexicon fixture engine — never the real personal file. Dev
  corpus byte-identical to wave 22 (no Corrector/LanguageModel touched);
  192/192 scenarios; swift test green (402 tests); simulator build green
  (xcodegen + Debug/iOS-Simulator).

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 29 phase 1: eval-studio v2 taxonomy (completed)

- **Trigger**: process review — iteration loop is dogfood recordings; needed
  context-efficient triage, compounding evaluations, roadmap from data.
- **Decided**: findings are pre-triaged against a class taxonomy (known vs
  NOVEL); lane posterior timelines rendered per session (Love-Island
  whiplash signature); AGGREGATE.md leads with a top-gaps table as **triage
  input**, not an automatic next-wave queue. Phase 2 shipped above: personal-
  eval as a hard wave gate, slangur registry, and pIcelandic recording.
  M1.5 later clarified that a taxonomy class must identify the actual engine
  stage before it can route roadmap work; prefix/suffix resemblance alone is
  not proof of an inflection failure.

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 22: compound acceptance

- **Trigger**: stökklrikanum→stökkleikanum UNRESOLVABLE (session
  2026-07-16T14-59-28); Icelandic compounding is productive, no lexicon holds
  it all. Symmetric hazard: valid OOV compounds get no conservatism shield.
- **Decided**: port the BinPackage/Greynir decomposition RULES
  (TypeEngine/Compounds.swift): head = longest BÍN suffix in an OPEN class
  (no/so/lo — their `_OPEN_CATS`), carrying the inflection; modifier = noun
  genitive (indefinite — the -s-/-ar-/-a-/-u- linking letters ARE genitive
  endings, no separate machinery), noun stem slot (kk þf.et / kvk nf.et /
  hk nf|þf.et), or strong-positive adjective genitive; ≤ 2 modifiers.
  Modifier legality reads paradigms.bin (only artifact with the
  DEFINITENESS bit — rule precision vs Miðeind's shipped prefix list is
  0.83 with it, 0.43 without; its lemma-freq≥10 floor stands in for their
  curation). BÍN's 358 bound suffix forms (ord.suffix.csv utg=-1:
  -leikanum, -menningur…) embedded as a static set — "leikanum" exists in
  no other artifact. Deviations, all tightening: min part lengths 4/4
  (dev sweep: 3/3 protects 2.7% of typo rows, 4/4 → 1.2%, positives kept),
  no adjective stems, no suffix-removals port, no tantum demotion.
- **Wiring — protection ≠ generation**: compound validity feeds ONLY the
  auto-apply veto (`isProtectedTypedWord`) + the restoration branch (lazy
  skeletons like "tungumal"=tungu+mal still restore via the triple gate);
  generation passes still gate on raw validity, so suggestions/splits for
  compound-shaped tokens are unchanged (protecting the split OFFERS was
  worth −1.3pp top-1 in the naive wiring). Repair pass 5b holds a legal
  modifier prefix fixed and single-edits the head — ERROR-class subs only
  (fold-priced twins walked junk compounds over honest repairs:
  prentletu→"prent+létu"), no strict-prefix extensions (completion pricing
  0.5/char structurally beats splits: "fimmtabókin"→"fimmtabókina"),
  generated heads need z ≥ −1.6 (junk tier "legan"/"legs" flooded the
  faralega bar), gate 4.5 (an honest single-insert repair at 4.0 —
  eldsnyti→eldsneyti — must shut the pass). Compounds score at frequency
  floor 1, STRICTLY below the BÍN floor 2: a whole word BÍN attests
  outranks any hypothesized decomposition at equal cost, mirroring
  Miðeind's whole-word-lookup-first order. Compound completions
  (stökklei→stökkleikur) built but DEFAULT OFF pending completion-specific
  pricing (wave 23 with the Kirkjubæjarklaustur split-case class).
- **Gates**: dev A/B compound on-vs-off: top-1 +0.13pp, false-ac ±0.00pp,
  ac-fired −0.60pp (protection veto); 192/192 scenarios ×3 (new
  compounds.scenarios: flagship offer, 4 typed-valid compounds protected,
  linking-letter case, dlmk/habb/eotthbap unharmed); swift test green both
  packages; bench max 3.2–6.1 ms (gate 30).

## 2026-07-17 — Small wave: sync staging leak + analyzer junk-tier gap (87b4b73, f4e7686)

- **Trigger**: 21×1.6MB lyklabord-sync-*.bin leaked in app tmp; analyzer
  missed "lss"→las because is.lex attests web junk.
- **Decided**: staging file deleted on success AND failure + day-old sweep at
  sync start. Analyzer: an is.lex attestation only counts when BÍN knows the
  word or z ≥ −1.0 — **BÍN validity is the signal separating junk from rare
  real words**, a pure z floor cannot (gil/snefil sit at lss's z).

## 2026-07-17 — Wave 28: stale-autocorrect apply guard (da3ed4d, 1f3b627)

- **Trigger**: "Lovr"+space applied the PREVIOUS word's autocorrect
  ("Þátturinn Þátturinn", Love destroyed), session 2026-07-17T08-30-35 —
  async race between engine queue and autocompleteContext at delimiter time.
  Collateral: mangled word flipped lane posterior, blocking a→á downstream.
- **Decided**: every bridged suggestion already carries its pending token
  (pendingTokenInfoKey); auto-apply refuses on token mismatch
  (AutocorrectApplyGuard, pure + unit-tested, fail-closed on missing stamp);
  delivery side drops results superseded by a newer request for different
  text. Ledger unaffected (snapshots actual before→after, nothing pre-armed).
  Skipped applies recorded as kind "stale-skip" — recurrence = regression.
- **Note**: 1f3b627 restored the CloudDocuments entitlement the wave's cleanup
  had mistakenly reverted (generated file lagged the committed spec).

## 2026-07-17 — CloudDocuments entitlement (dead70b)

- **Trigger**: OTA session export never reached the Mac; ubiquity folder
  never materialized.
- **Root cause**: icloud-services listed only CloudKit — CloudDocuments is
  the service that actually runs iCloud Drive document sync. Bundle version
  bumped 1→2 (iCloud Drive re-reads NSUbiquitousContainers only on version
  change). App-only; extension keeps zero iCloud.

## 2026-07-16 — Wave 26: learning self-poisoning (b458efe)

- **Trigger**: session 2026-07-16T22-45-30 — mid-sentence Title Case
  (furir→Fyrir, frabær→Frábær, nyju→Nýju, syba→Sýna) and dead restoration
  (þvi/þer/gret/eg/sa silent, bar ranked accented form 0.8–0.99 but ac=false).
  Device-only; harness reproduced ONLY with PERSONAL seeds → root cause was
  in-memory learned vocabulary, not code/data drift.
- **Decided**: (1) leading-cap learned surface folds to pipeline casing when
  lowercase is common base vocab (typicality test, NOT BÍN casing —
  bin-morph.bin lowercases everything); sentence-initial commits strip autocap
  at capture. Miðeind-class OOV caps preserved. (2) implicitly-learned pure
  acute-fold twins of ≥10×-dominant base words lose the conservatism veto;
  their personal counts TRANSFER to the twin (the lazy commits were commits
  of the twin — this transfer is what made grét clear the margin). Explicit
  adds, verbatim taps, tombstones keep full veto.
- **Gate note**: dev corpus byte-identical (machinery inert without personal
  snapshot) — personal-state bugs are invisible to the synthetic corpus,
  hence phase-2 requirement that personal-eval gates waves.

## 2026-07-16 — Wave 24: session-findings precision wave (08f4ae1)

- **Trigger**: first four real recordings (kozy→jozy false fire, læt.hann
  dotted-escape, sivan→síðan v↔ð, MEÐ/NEW all-caps bar junk, hega→geta).
- **Decided**: junk-tier margin scaling (winner z < −1.0 → margin ×3) instead
  of a blunt z floor — A/B showed 88% of blunt-floor removals were CORRECT
  fires; v→ð directional confusion priced; all-caps learned-surface guard
  (precursor of wave 26's full fix); determinism: childList byte-sorted.
- **Also**: context-vouched short-double-sub admission (20a5ab1): edit-cost
  cap 1.2→1.4 (g→t vertical-diagonal ≈1.25 nats) + admission requires
  attested bigram with previous word + calibrated z ≥ 1.0 — blunt z lowering
  regressed corpus top-1 by 0.10pp, context vouching didn't.

## 2026-07-16 — Session pipeline (ab8d3a8, dda3396, 6007645, ed2fb78)

- Recorder (dev-mode pad only, dual JSONL + tap coordinates + bar snapshots),
  analyzer v2 (silent-miss scan via type-repl attestation, alignment fix),
  proxy-edit ledger (azooKey pattern — exact self-edit attribution so user
  edits aren't misread as engine corrections), OTA via user's own iCloud
  ubiquity container, build stamping (engineCommit; "+dirty" is a false
  positive — the stamp script dirties its own tracked file), aggregates.
- **Decided**: recordings are personal data — sessions/, personal-eval.jsonl,
  confirmed-intents.jsonl gitignored forever.

## 2026-07-16 — Confirmed-intents (27b9e54)

- **Trigger**: analyzer pending-review queue had no way to absorb the user's
  answers ("dlmk = dæmi").
- **Decided**: confirmed-intents.jsonl maps typo→intended (or intentional:
  true for slangur like "kozy") and promotes contested/UNRESOLVABLE silent
  misses into personal-eval.jsonl with source=user-confirmed. Intentional
  marks are the seed of the slangur registry.
