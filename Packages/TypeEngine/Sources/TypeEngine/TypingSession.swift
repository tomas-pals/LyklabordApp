///    becomes a committing delimiter once the next event shows whitespace/
///    another delimiter after it ("word. " commits; "word.t" keeps growing
///    one dotted token),
/// 2. classify how the window changed since the previous call and only
///    treat a delimiter-completed word as committed when the change is a
///    valid single-keystroke evolution. The classification is ledger-first
///    (azooKey's expected-edit pattern, research/oss-harvest.md §2): an

///    slide) remain as (a) the shape classifier for explained changes and
///    (b) the whole classifier for embedders that never record self-edits,
/// 3. feed genuinely committed words to `TypeEngine.confirmWord` (language
///    posterior update),

///    suggestions (single-letter prefixes hit the 20k-entry completion scan
///    cap on is.lex, ~2.8 ms/call; 2+ char prefixes have far smaller
///    ranges; an empty current word is next-word prediction, which is
///    cheap),
/// 5. ask the engine for suggestions, then apply the verbatim/URL layers:
///    the literal typed token always leads the bar (verbatim escape hatch,
///    mapped to KeyboardKit's quoted `.unknown` type by the extension),
