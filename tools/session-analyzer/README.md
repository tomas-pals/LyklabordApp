# session-analyzer

Offline analysis for DEV-MODE typing-session recordings (see
`docs/PRIVACY.md` → "Developer mode", `App/RecordingStore.swift`,
`KeyboardExt/SessionRecorder.swift`).

Recording is a developer-only affordance: it captures ground truth **only**
from the app's own "Upptökusvæði" pad — never any third-party app — and is off
by default. Each session produces two JSONL files in the App Group container's
`Documents/sessions/`:

- `<id>-app.jsonl` — the authoritative timeline: the full pad text snapshotted
  on every change, with timestamps.
- `<id>-kb.jsonl` — one record per keyboard `suggestions()` pass: window tail,
  the suggestion bar (texts + `ac`/`vb`/`rs` flags + confidence), the applied
  action (autocorrect / suggestion tap / none), touch samples since the last
  pass, backspaces, and the field kind.

## Getting sessions off the device

Two paths, both landing in `./sessions/`:

### 1. OTA via the developer's own iCloud Drive (no cable)

On **stop** (and retroactively for any earlier unexported session), developer
mode copies each session's `-app.jsonl` + `-kb.jsonl` + a `-meta.json` manifest
into the app's iCloud ubiquity container (`iCloud.com.supermassiveapps.lyklabord`,
document-scope-public). It syncs to **the developer's own iCloud Drive** — no
servers — and lands on this Mac at:

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~is~solberg~lyklabord/Documents/sessions
```

Note the tilde-encoding: the container id `iCloud.com.supermassiveapps.lyklabord` becomes
`iCloud~is~solberg~lyklabord` (dots → tildes, **no** team prefix and **no** `.ios`
suffix). Override with `--ubiquity-dir` / `LYKLABORD_UBIQUITY_DIR` if your
account encodes it differently.

### 2. USB pull (`pull.sh`)

```sh
./pull.sh                 # auto-pick the first connected device
./pull.sh <device-udid>   # xcrun devicectl list devices
```

Copies `Documents/sessions/` from the app container (`com.supermassiveapps.lyklabord`) into
`./sessions/`. Requires Xcode 15+ (`xcrun devicectl`), device paired &
unlocked, app installed. (Simulator: use
`xcrun simctl get_app_container booted com.supermassiveapps.lyklabord data` and copy
`Documents/sessions` by hand — `devicectl` is device-only.)

## Ingest (collect + analyze + aggregate)

`ingest.py` is the one command to run — it pulls from every source into
`./sessions/`, analyzes new arrivals, and rebuilds the aggregate + corpus:

```sh
python3 ingest.py            # one pass (iCloud mirror → sessions/ → analyze → aggregate)
python3 ingest.py --watch    # poll every 15s while you type on the device
python3 ingest.py --ubiquity-dir DIR --pull-dir DIR --sessions-dir DIR
```

Dedupe is by **session id**: a file is copied only when absent or larger
(sessions are append-only, so larger == superset). Only changed sessions are
re-analyzed. A missing iCloud dir is skipped, never fatal.

## Aggregate

`aggregate.py` (run for you by `ingest.py`, or standalone) rolls **all**
sessions up **by engine build** (from each `-meta.json`'s `engineCommit`,
stamped at build time via `App/BuildInfo.swift`; sessions with no manifest
group under `unknown`). It writes, into the gitignored `sessions/` dir:

- `AGGREGATE.md` — per-build totals + rates (autocorrect false-positive rate,
  MISS_OFFERED/ABSENT, inflection-shaped hints, SILENT_MISS, taps/session), a **weighted
  per-key tap-offset** table, a **PATTERNS** section (recurring `typo→intended`
  pairs and same-category counts = tuning candidates; singles = watch list), a
  **build-over-build trend** table (does a new build regress real-typing
  rates?), and **PENDING-REVIEW** (ambiguous cases awaiting confirmation).
- `aggregate.json` — the same, machine-readable.

```sh
python3 aggregate.py [sessions-dir]   # default: ./sessions
```

## Personal eval corpus

`aggregate.py` also maintains **`personal-eval.jsonl`** (this dir; **gitignored**
— it quotes real typed text): confirmed, unambiguous candidates in the
`data/eval/dev.jsonl` schema, deduped and **append-only**, each with provenance
(`session`, `engine_commit`, `class`, `source`). This is a **first-class tuning
gate** — a build change must not regress these cases.

Eligible (unambiguous intended word): `AUTOCORRECT_UNDONE`, `MISS_OFFERED`,
`MISS_ABSENT` (the user produced the intended word themselves), plus
`SILENT_MISS` **only** when the top guess is uncontested (single penalty-0 edit
that clearly beats the runner-up). Held back to `PENDING-REVIEW` in
`AGGREGATE.md`: shape-only `INFLECTION_MISS` findings and
contested `SILENT_MISS`. Nothing ambiguous enters the corpus without Jökull's
confirmation. Ordinary phrase rewrites are not correction evidence: when a
short fragment is deleted before commit and replaced by unrelated text (the
observed `a` then `ef` shape), the analyzer drops the pair unless the keyboard
log proves it was an autocorrect undo.

## Privacy / git hygiene

`sessions/` and `personal-eval.jsonl` are **gitignored**: every output that
quotes typed text (`AGGREGATE.md`, `aggregate.json`, `<id>-report.md`,
`<id>-candidates.jsonl`, `<id>-meta.json`, the corpus) stays local. Only this
README and the scripts are committed. The iCloud copy goes to the developer's
**own** iCloud Drive and is user-visible + deletable in Files (see
`docs/PRIVACY.md` → "Þróunarhamur").

## Analyze

```sh
python3 analyze.py [sessions-dir]   # default: ./sessions
```

For each session it writes `<id>-report.md` (counts, event list with context,
per-key tap-offset stats) and `<id>-candidates.jsonl` (eval-ready cases, shaped
like `data/eval/dev.jsonl`).

### Event classes

| class | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `AUTOCORRECT_UNDONE` | keyboard auto-applied a correction; user backspaced to restore what they typed (a false autocorrect) |
| `MISS_OFFERED` | user backspace-retyped to a word that **was** in the bar while typing — gating too conservative |
| `MISS_ABSENT` | user backspace-retyped to a word the bar never offered — a ranking / candidate miss |
| `INFLECTION_MISS` | raw shape detector: intended word shares a long prefix with a bar offer differing in a short ending. The taxonomy upgrades this to `inflection · watch` **only** when both forms share an exact lemma from the shipping BÍN binary; otherwise it is `inflection-shape-hint · triage-uncertain` and must not route roadmap work. |
| `TAP_USED` | user tapped a suggestion |
| `CLEAN` | word committed with no correction, retype, or tap |

### Erase-then-retype alignment (v2)

Episodes are reconstructed word-level (difflib over the peak-vs-end word
lists) with plausibility-based pairing. When a user erases one word and
retypes a **longer** stretch, only the aligned word is paired (shared stem /
cheap edit); the extra words are insertions. E.g. erasing `foðu` and retyping
`af góðu` yields `foðu`→`góðu`, with `af` dropped (v1 mispaired `foðu`→`af`).

### Silent-miss pass (v2)

After episode analysis the analyzer scans the **final committed text** for
uncorrected typos and writes them to a `## Silent misses` section in the
report (human-in-the-loop signal, not eval candidates):

- `SILENT_MISS` — token not attested in either lexicon but with a
  high-frequency neighbour within 1–2 cheap keyboard/accent edits. Candidates
  are ranked by edit penalty (0 = one cheap edit, 1 = two, 2 = a non-adjacent
  substitution) then frequency.
- `UNRESOLVABLE` — no confident neighbour (keyboard mash / out-of-lexicon
  compound).

Attestation is authoritative via the engine: the analyzer shells to the
prebuilt `type-repl` binary and batches `:word <tok>` (curated `is.lex`/`en.lex`
membership plus BÍN validity, cases, and exact lemma candidates from the same
artifact the engine ships). If the binary is
absent it falls back to plain membership in the frequency corpora
(`data/is/unigrams.json.gz`, `data/en/en-80k.txt`) — less precise. The
keyboard-adjacency model mirrors `SpatialModel.icelandicRows`. Build the
binary once with:

```sh
( cd ../../Packages/TypeEngine && swift build -c release --product type-repl )
```

### Known-class triage tagging (v3)

Every finding — a corrector `Event` or a `SILENT_MISS`/`UNRESOLVABLE` — gets a
`[class · status]` tag from the checked-in taxonomy in **`taxonomy.py`** (this
file IS committed; it contains no personal typed text, only class
definitions). Precedence (first match wins): `slangur-intentional` >
`stale-apply` > `valid-word-overlap` > `inflection` > `space-miss` >
`compound-oov` > `restoration-fold` > `deep-decode` > `context-ranking` >
`proper-noun-oov` > `NOVEL`. `NOVEL` findings (matched nothing) get their own
section at the **top** of the report; any finding tagged with a `fixed:*`
status (a shipped fix recurring) renders in a loud `⚠ REGRESSIONS` section,
also at the top. See `taxonomy.py`'s `CLASSES` for the full detect/status/notes
per class, and `test_analyze.py`'s `test_taxonomy_*` functions for worked
examples against this repo's own real cases (þvi→því, syndur→sýndur,
stökklrikanum→stökkleikanum, eotthbap→eitthvað, kozy, …).

`taxonomy.classify_finding` is pure (no type-repl, no kb.jsonl) — analyze.py's
`tag_findings` gathers the real context (BÍN/is.lex attestation via
`type-repl`, live bar contents, confirmed-intents overrides) and feeds it in.

### Lane posterior timeline (v3)

Each report gets a `## Lane posterior timeline` section: the session's final
committed text is replayed word-by-word through `type-repl`'s interactive
REPL (one word per line → one `state P(IS)=` report per commit, see
`Repl.swift`'s `report()`), giving a cheap per-word IS-lane posterior without
any TypeEngine changes. A single-step swing > 0.35 is flagged `⚠` (lane
whiplash — the Love-Island poisoning signature) and counted per session in
`aggregate.json`. Cost: dominated by process/engine startup, not per-word
work — a ~50-word session finishes in well under a second.

### Top gaps (v3, in AGGREGATE.md)

`AGGREGATE.md` leads with a **Top gaps** table: every tagged finding across
every session, bucketed by class, with a total count, a count restricted to
the latest 3 sessions, a rising/flat/falling trend (latest-3 rate vs. the
rate over every prior session), and a `typo → intended` example. `NOVEL` and
any recurring `fixed:*` class sort first; `slangur-intentional` and
`valid-word-overlap` (doctrine non-fires, never gaps) are excluded from the
ranking and reported as a separate visible count instead. This table is
**triage input**, not an automatic next-wave roadmap: a finding must first be
classified as a discovery, ranking, action-policy, or session/proxy failure.
`triage-uncertain` explicitly marks detectors that cannot yet make that call.

### Greynir grammar-parse enrichment (v4, OPTIONAL)

**Setup** (one-time, local): install [reynir](https://pypi.org/project/reynir/)
into a dedicated venv so it never touches the ambient interpreter or the
`~/Forks/GreynirEngine` reference checkout:

```sh
cd tools/session-analyzer
uv venv .venv            # plain `python3 -m venv` can fail with uv-managed
                          # pythons — use uv if venv creation errors out
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python reynir
```

reynir bundles/downloads its own BÍN data (via `islenska`) on first use —
that's expected, local-only tooling data. `.venv/` and the parse cache
`.greynir-cache.json` are gitignored (same rule as `sessions/`: the cache
quotes real typed sentences).

This is entirely **optional and additive** — every feature below degrades to
today's behaviour (a one-line `_greynir: unavailable_` note, never an
exception) if the venv or `reynir` import is missing. `analyze.py` stays
stdlib-importable: the actual `reynir`/`islenska` calls live in
`greynir_worker.py`, which only ever runs inside `.venv` via a subprocess
`greynir_enrich.py` shells out to — one batched invocation per session,
covering every sentence/word that session needs, with results cached on disk
per sentence-hash / lowercase word so re-ingests of an unchanged corpus
dispatch no subprocess at all.

Four report additions, all advisory (never change engine behavior):

- **Grammar review** (new report section): every sentence of the session's
  FINAL text is parsed; a failed or very-low-score parse is listed with the
  sentence and a `grammar` (genuine residual typo/structure the engine
  couldn't untangle) vs. `foreign-token` (a tokenizer-`UNKNOWN` chunk, or a
  token confirmed-intents.jsonl marks `intentional` — e.g. `kozy`) reason.
  Deliberately NOT keyed on "lacks Icelandic diacritics" — that would
  mislabel ordinary accent-drop typos (`þvi`, `Eg`) as foreign.
- **`grammar-vouched-overlap`** (new taxonomy class, status `watch`): an
  UPGRADE applied to `valid-word-overlap` findings — the sentence is parsed
  once with the typed word, once with the intended word substituted; if
  Greynir genuinely prefers the intended version (it parses cleanly and
  either the typed version doesn't parse at all, or its score clearly loses
  by a margin), the tag upgrades and the finding — unlike plain
  `valid-word-overlap` — ranks in the **Top gaps** table (candidate for
  future context-aware margin work, measured not yet acted on). Excludes
  `TAP_USED` and any typo that's a strict prefix of intended (a mid-word tap
  fragment "not parsing" as a complete word is an artifact, not grammar
  evidence).
- **Case government audit** (new report section): for raw `INFLECTION_MISS`
  findings, an independent BÍN case-form lookup on typed vs. intended; for
  the final text, every preposition Greynir's own parse resolves a governed
  case for, cross-checked against the following word's independent BÍN case
  set. One line per disagreement; `_none found_` is the expected steady
  state once a sentence already parses (case agreement is enforced by the
  grammar for a successful parse) — it earns its keep on partial/failed
  parses and un-BÍN-attested inflection fragments.
- **Candidate disambiguation** (PENDING-REVIEW, `AGGREGATE.md`): for
  `SILENT_MISS` findings, each of the top-3 candidates is substituted into
  the sentence and annotated `[parses]`/`[fails]` — sharpens the list for
  Jökull's own confirmation; never auto-promotes anything to the corpus.

## Test

```sh
python3 test_analyze.py   # exit 0 = pass
```

Runs the classifier on `fixtures/fixture-*.jsonl`, a hand-built session with
exactly one event of each class (living documentation of the wire format), plus
the v2 alignment/inflection/silent-miss behaviours, the v3 taxonomy
classifier (`test_taxonomy_*`, `test_stale_apply_detection`) against real
cases and small fabricated fixtures, and the v4 Greynir enrichment
(`test_greynir_*`, in `greynir_enrich.py`): pure-logic tests with fabricated
parse results (no venv needed), a monkeypatched graceful-degradation check,
a stubbed end-to-end vouch-upgrade check, and one real integration check
(`test_greynir_real_integration`) that actually shells out to reynir on a
known sentence — skipped cleanly, not failed, when `.venv` isn't set up.
