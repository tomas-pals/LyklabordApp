/// The compacted personal learning store: word counts with per-language
/// attribution, capped bigram counts, tombstones, user-added words, and the
/// per-key adaptive touch statistics. Owned and persisted by the containing
/// app; the keyboard extension loads a read-only copy (or a
/// `PersonalLexicon` snapshot) at launch.
///
/// ## Hard constraints (from PLAN)
///
/// - **Surface forms only.** Icelandic surface forms overlap heavily across
///   lemmas ("á" = preposition | river | eiga-form), so learned counts are
///   keyed by the exact committed string — byte-exact, case-preserving.
///   There is NO lemma-level merging anywhere in this type; the documented
///   wave-2 seam for unambiguous-only lemma *boosts* is `LemmaBoostProviding`.
/// - **Tombstones win.** A word the user deleted in the dictionary editor is
///   never auto-relearned — not by commits, not by verbatim taps — until the
///   user explicitly re-adds it (`addUserWord`) or clears the tombstone.
/// - **Single words / pairs only**, mirroring the event-log privacy
///   invariants. Nothing here can reconstruct running text.
///
/// ## Learning threshold
///
/// A word becomes *learned* (valid for suggestions/autocorrect protection)
/// only after commits on `Configuration.learnedDayThreshold` distinct day
/// buckets (default 2), OR immediately on an explicit signal (verbatim-tap
/// `wordTapped`, or `addUserWord`). Rationale: one-off typos routinely get
/// committed once; requiring a second, later day filters them out without
/// asking the user anything — the SwiftKey failure mode (typo pollution) in
/// reverse. Explicit signals skip the threshold because the user literally
/// pointed at the word and said "this one".
///
/// ## Decay ("the corpus adapts around the user")
///
/// At compaction, when the summed word count exceeds
/// `Configuration.decayTotalCountCeiling`, every word and bigram count is
/// scaled by `decayFactor` (default 0.5, integer floor). Entries that reach
/// zero are dropped — unless explicitly signalled or user-added — so
/// abandoned vocabulary eventually vanishes while active vocabulary keeps
/// getting re-inflated by fresh commits. Multiplicative decay preserves
/// relative ranking; the ceiling bounds both file size and how long stale
/// habits linger. Touch statistics decay separately (see `TouchKeyStats`,
/// per-key threshold) because taps arrive orders of magnitude faster than
/// new vocabulary.
///
/// ## Persistence
///
/// A single versioned JSON file (`schemaVersion` top-level field), written
/// with `.atomic` (write-temp-then-rename). JSON over a custom binary
/// format is deliberate: personal scale is small (a few thousand words —
/// well under the 1MB target), Codable gives free forward evolution via
/// optional fields, and a human-readable store is part of the transparency
/// story (the user can literally read everything the keyboard knows).
/// Loaded fully into memory; all queries are dictionary lookups.
