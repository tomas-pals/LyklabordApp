/// Thin `NSFileCoordinator` wrappers for App Group files shared between the
/// keyboard extension (event-log writer) and the containing app (compactor,
/// model owner). Both sides MUST route every `EventLog` / `PersonalModel`
/// disk touch through these so a compaction rewrite can never interleave
/// with an append.
///
/// Usage expectations at the call boundary:
///
/// - **Extension (writer)**: batch events in memory; flush inside ONE short
///   `coordinateWrite` block at word boundaries / `viewWillDisappear` — never
///   per keystroke, and never hold the coordination across an await. Apple
///   documents that app extensions holding file coordination while being
///   suspended can deadlock the host — keep blocks synchronous and tiny, and
///   treat a coordination failure as "drop this batch" (learning data is
///   lossy-tolerant by design).
/// - **App (compactor)**: run read + merge + model-save + log-truncate inside
///   ONE `coordinateWrite` block on the log URL (the model file has a single
///   owner — the app — and only needs coordination if the extension ever
///   reads it directly; today the extension gets model data via its own
///   loaded copy, so plain atomic writes suffice there).
/// - Never cache file descriptors or `Data` across coordination blocks.
///
/// Linux has neither `NSFileCoordinator` nor App Groups. The `#if` below
/// keeps the Darwin implementation byte-identical and degrades the Linux
/// build to a direct passthrough so the package (and everything downstream
/// of it — `TypeEngine`, `type-repl`, `type-eval`) compiles and tests on a
/// non-Apple host. Nothing that ships to a device takes the passthrough.
